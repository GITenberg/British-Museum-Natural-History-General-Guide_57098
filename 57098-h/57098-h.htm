<div class="sidenote">Foundation.</div>

<p>The British Museum dates its foundation from the year 1753,
when an Act of Parliament was passed “for the purchase
of the Museum or Collection of Sir Hans Sloane, and of the
Harleian Collection of Manuscripts, and for providing One
General Repository for the better Reception and more convenient
Use of the said Collections and of the Cottonian Library and of
the Additions thereto.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Hans Sloane.</div>

<p>Sir Hans Sloane, an eminent physician in London, was for
sixteen years President of the Royal College of Physicians,
and in 1727 succeeded Sir Isaac Newton in the Presidential
Chair of the Royal Society. He was throughout his long
life a diligent and miscellaneous collector, having, as stated in
the Preamble of the Act of Incorporation of the Museum,
“through the course of many years, with great labour and
expense, gathered together whatever could be procured, either
in our own or foreign countries, that was rare and curious.”
His collection, which at the time of his death in 1753 was
contained in his residence, the Manor House, Chelsea, consisted
of “Books, Manuscripts, Prints, Medals, and Coins, ancient
and modern, Seals, Cameos and Intaglios, Precious Stones,
Agates, Jaspers, Vessels of Agate and Jasper, Crystals, Mathematical
Instruments, Drawings, and Pictures,” and included
numerous zoological and geological specimens, as well as an
extensive herbarium of dried plants preserved in 333 large folio
volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
According to the terms of Sir Hans Sloane’s will, this collection
was purchased for the sum of £20,000—far below its
intrinsic value—in order “that it might be preserved and
maintained, not only for the inspection and entertainment of
the learned and the curious, but for the general use and benefit
of the public to all posterity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Montagu House, Bloomsbury.</div>

<p>The valuable collection of manuscripts formed by Sir Robert
Cotton at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth
centuries was already the property of the nation, having
been presented by his grandson, Sir John Cotton, in the year
1700. The Harley Collection was obtained by purchase at
the same time as the Sloane, and the three were brought
together under the designation of “the British Museum,” placed
under the care of a body of Trustees,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and lodged in Montagu
House, Bloomsbury, purchased for their reception in 1754. The
Museum was opened to the public on the 15th of January, 1759.
Admission to the galleries of antiquities and natural history was
at first by ticket only after application in writing, and limited
to ten persons, for three hours in the day. Instead of being
allowed to inspect the cases at their leisure, visitors were conducted
through the galleries by officers of the house. The hours of
admission were subsequently extended; but it was not until the
year 1810 that the Museum was freely accessible to the general
public for three days in the week, from ten to four o’clock.
The daily opening, with longer hours in summer, dates from 1879.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of Collections necessitating additional space.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution to separate Natural History Collection.</div>

<p>At the time of the foundation of the Museum, the site allotted
seemed amply sufficient for its purposes; but gradually, as the
collections increased, they outgrew the limits, not only of
the original Montagu House, but even of its successor, the
present classical building, completed in 1845 from the designs
of Sir Robert Smirke. The erection of the magnificent
reading-room in 1857 disposed for a time of the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of finding accommodation for the ever-growing library; but
the keepers of other departments continued urgent in their
demands for more space, and after much discussion of rival
plans for keeping the collections together and obtaining the
needful extension of room by acquiring the property immediately
around the old Museum, or for severing the collections and
removing a portion to another building, the latter course was
finally decided upon. At a special general meeting of the
Trustees, held on the 21st of January, 1860, attended by many
members of the Government in their official capacity, a resolution,
moved by the First Lord of the Treasury, was carried
“That it is expedient that the Natural History Collection be
removed from the British Museum, inasmuch as such an
arrangement would be attended with considerably less expense
than would be incurred by providing a sufficient additional
space in immediate contiguity to the present building of the
British Museum.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purchase of a Site at South Kensington.</div>

<p>The House of Commons, in the Session of 1863, sanctioned
the purchase of part of the site of the International Exhibition
of 1862 at South Kensington, with a view to appropriating it to
the purpose of a Museum of Natural History.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Competitive designs.</div>

<p>In January, 1864, the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Works
issued an advertisement for designs for a Natural History
Museum and a Patent Museum, to be erected on part of the land
thus acquired; a plan which had been prepared by Mr. Hunt in
September, 1862, from Sir Richard Owen’s suggestions, being
proposed as a model in respect to dimensions and internal
arrangement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Captain Fowke’s plan.</div>

<p>The plans of the various competitors were submitted to Her
Majesty’s Commissioners of Works, who awarded prizes to three
of the number, giving precedence to that of Captain Francis
Fowke, R.E., and then referred the three selected plans to the
Trustees of the British Museum. As the internal arrangements
in Captain Fowke’s plan did not meet with the approval of the
Museum officers, he was desired to modify them in conformity
with the requirements of the Trustees, and was engaged in this
labour when his death occurred, in September, 1865.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Waterhouse engaged.</div>

<p>Early in the year 1866, Mr. Alfred Waterhouse was invited by
the Chief Commissioner of Works to take up the unfinished work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
of Captain Fowke, but found himself unable to complete the
plan to his own satisfaction. In February, 1868, he was accordingly
commissioned to form a fresh design, embodying the
requirements of the officers of the Natural History Departments
of the Museum.</p>

<p>Mr. Waterhouse was not long in submitting to the Trustees his
plan and model of the building, with a disposition of galleries as
required, and these were formally accepted by the Trustees in
April, 1868. It was not, however, until February 1871 that
the working plans had been thoroughly considered, and had
received the final approval of the Trustees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Completion of building and removal of Collections.</div>

<p>The actual work of erection commenced in the year 1873, and
the building was handed over to the Trustees of the British
Museum by Her Majesty’s Commissioners of Works in the
month of June, 1880. As soon as the exhibition-cases were
completed, and the galleries sufficiently dry to receive the collections,
the labour of removing the Natural History Collection from
Bloomsbury was begun. The departments of Geology, Mineralogy,
and Botany were arranged in their respective sections of
the Museum in the course of the year 1880, and the portion of
the Museum which contained these departments was first opened
to the public on April 18th, 1881. It was not until the following
year that the cases destined to receive the larger collections
of the Zoological Department were sufficiently near completion
to allow of these collections following, and three more years
were required before all the galleries could be brought into a
state fitted for public exhibition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of the building.</div>

<p>The following description of the structure was contributed by
Mr. <span class="locked">Waterhouse:—</span></p>

<p>“The New Natural History Museum will, from its position,
always be more or less identified with the International
Exhibition of 1862, which occupied the whole of the site
between the Horticultural Gardens and Cromwell Road. It
was at one time thought that a portion, at any rate, of the
Exhibition buildings could with advantage have been converted
into a Museum of Natural History. Parliament, however,
decided against the preservation of any part of these buildings,
and they were accordingly entirely removed.</p>

<p>“In designing the present building, Captain Fowke’s original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
idea of employing terra-cotta was always kept in view, though
the blocks were reduced in size, so as to obviate, as far as
possible, the objection to the employment of this material,
arising from its liability to twist in burning. For this and
other reasons the architect abandoned the idea of a Renaissance
building, and fell back on the earlier Romanesque style
which prevailed largely in Lombardy and the Rhineland from
the tenth to the end of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>“In 1873, a contract was entered into by the Government
with Messrs. George Baker and Sons, of Lambeth, for the
erection of the building at a cost of £352,000. Other subsequent
contracts have been entered into by the Treasury,
especially one for the erection of the towers, which in the
first instance it was decided to omit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exterior.</div>

<p>“On looking at the exterior of the building, one of the first
points which strikes a spectator is that the site is lower than
the street. This arises from the fact that the whole surface
of the ground between the three roads was excavated for the
Exhibition building of 1862, and it was not thought desirable,
for economical considerations, to refill the space. The building
is set back 100 feet from the Cromwell Road, and is approached
by two inclined planes, curved on plan and supported by arches,
forming carriage-ways. Between the two are broad flights of
Craigleith stone steps, for the use of those approaching the
building on foot. The extreme length of the front is 675 feet,
and the height of the towers is 192 feet. The return fronts,
east and west, beyond the end pavilions, have not yet been
erected.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interior. Central Hall.</div>

<p>“On entering the main portal, the visitor has before him the
great central apartment of the Museum (170 feet long, by 97 feet
wide, and 72 feet high), which it is intended to use as an Index or
Typical Museum. The double arch in the immediate foreground
which spans the nave (57 feet wide), carries the staircase from
the first to the second floor. Opposite the spectator, at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the hall, is the first flight of the staircase, 20 feet wide, which
rises from the ground to the first floor. The galleries over the
side recesses form the connection between the two staircases,
and are also intended for exhibition space, as are also the floor of
the main hall and the side recesses under the galleries. The
arches under the side-flights of the main staircase at the end of
the hall lead into another large apartment, with an extreme
length of 97 by 77 feet measured into the arms of the cross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Side galleries.</div>

<p>“Branching out of the Central Hall, near its southern
extremity, are two long galleries, each 278 feet 6 inches long by
50 feet wide. These galleries are repeated on the first floor, and
in a modified form on the second floor. They are divided into
bays by coupled piers arranged in two rows down the length of
the galleries, and planned in such a manner as to allow of upright
cases being placed back to back between the piers and the outer
walls, so as to get the best possible light upon the objects
displayed in the cases with the least amount of reflection from
the glass, and leaving the central space free as a passage.
Owing to the nature of the specimens exhibited in one or two
of these galleries requiring for their exhibition rather table-cases
than wall-cases, advantage has only been taken to a
limited extent of this disposition of the plan. These terra-cotta
piers, however, are constructively necessary, not only to conceal
the iron supports for the floor above, but to prevent these supports
being affected in case of fire. Behind these galleries on the ground
floor are a series of toplighted galleries, devoted, on the east side
to Geology and Palæontology, and on the west to Zoology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towers.</div>

<p>“The towers on the north of the building have each a central
smoke-shaft from the heating apparatus, the boilers of which
are placed in the basement, immediately between the towers,
while the space surrounding the smoke-shafts is used for drawing
off the vitiated air from the various galleries contiguous
thereto. The front galleries are ventilated into the front towers,
which form the crowning feature of the main front. These
towers also contain, above the second floor, various rooms for
the work of the different departments, and on the topmost
storey large cisterns for the purpose of always having at hand a
considerable storage of water in case of fire. On the western side
of the building, where it is intended that the Zoological collection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
shall be placed, the ornamentation of the terra-cotta (which will
be found very varied both within and without the building) has
been based exclusively on living organisms. On the east side,
where Geology and Palæontology find a home, the terra-cotta
ornamentation has been derived from extinct specimens.</p>

<p>“The Museum is the largest, if not, indeed, the only, modern
building in which terra-cotta has been exclusively used for
external façades and interior wall-surfaces, including all the
varied decoration which this involves.”</p>

are open to the public whenever the Museum itself is open,

<h2 id="GENERAL_ARRANGEMENT"><span id="c9">GENERAL ARRANGEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Use of the term Natural History.</div>

<p>Natural History is an old term, used to describe the study
of all the processes or laws of the Universe, and the results
of the action of those processes or laws upon such of its
constituent materials <em>as are independent of the agency of man</em>.</p>

<p>It is thus contrasted with the history of Man and his works,
and the changes which have been wrought in the World by
Man’s intervention.</p>

<p>This distinction afforded a convenient and rational basis for
the division of the numerous and multifarious objects which had
been collected together in the British Museum at Bloomsbury.
When it was decided to effect a separation of the collections,
those that were purely the products of what are commonly called
“natural” forces were removed to South Kensington, while those
showing the effects of Man’s handiwork remained at Bloomsbury.
Like most others of the kind, this distinction cannot
be applied very rigidly. Such lines of demarcation almost
always overlap. For instance, examples of modification of
animal or plant structure under Man’s influence legitimately
find a place in a Museum of Natural History, especially as
they may afford illustrations of the mode of working of natural
laws. Prehistoric stone-implements, again, are shown in the
Geological Department, in order to illustrate the co-existence
of Man with extinct Mammals.</p>

<p>Processes or laws cannot, however, be satisfactorily demonstrated
in a museum; therefore such branches of knowledge as
deal chiefly with these, as Astronomy, Geology (in the stricter
sense of the word), and the experimental sciences, as Physics,
Chemistry and Physiology, though essentially belonging to
the domain of Natural History, have not found a place in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Natural History Museum. It is only the results of the
working of these processes or laws, as shown in the modifications
of the arrangement of the elementary substances of which
the material of the Universe is composed, which can be fully
illustrated by specimens admitting of being readily preserved
and permanently exhibited in a museum. A Natural History
Museum, therefore, in the sense in which the term is now
usually understood, is a collection of the various objects,
animate and inanimate, found in a state of nature. It will
be readily understood that as the study of such objects is
one of the principal means by which the laws leading to
their formation or arrangement may be traced out, it is of
the utmost importance for the progress of those departments
of knowledge which the Museum is designed to cultivate, to
bring together as full an illustrative series of these objects as
possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division into Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.</div>

<p>Although the validity of the division of natural objects
into <em>inorganic</em> and <em>organic</em> or <em>living</em> has been the subject of
some discussion, and although the separation of the latter
into <em>vegetable</em> and <em>animal</em> is less absolute than was once
supposed, yet for practical purposes, <span class="smcap">Mineral</span>, <span class="smcap">Vegetable</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Animal</span> remain the three great divisions or “kingdoms”
into which natural bodies are grouped, and this classification
has formed the basis of the arrangement of the collections in
the Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mineral Department.</div>

<p>I. Inorganic substances occur in nature in a gaseous,
liquid, or solid form. With few exceptions, it is only
in the latter state that they can be conveniently preserved
and exhibited in a museum, and it is to such that
the term “mineral” is commonly limited. The collection,
classification, and exhibition of specimens of this kind is the
office of the Mineral Department of the Museum, to which
is devoted the large gallery on the first floor of the east wing
of the building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Botanical Department.</div>

<p>II. The study of the vegetable kingdom, so far as it can be
illustrated by preserved specimens, is the province of the
Department of Botany, which occupies the upper floor of the
east wing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zoological Department.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Entomological Department.</div>

<p>III. In the same way the animal kingdom belongs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Department of Zoology, from which it has been found necessary
to separate an Entomological Department. To these two is
assigned the whole of the western wing of the building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geological Department.</div>

<p>There is, however, a fifth department, which owes its separate
existence to a time when the terms Zoology and Botany were
limited to the study of the existing forms of animal and plant
life, and the extinct or fossil forms were associated with
minerals, rather than with their living representatives. This
arrangement prevailed in the British Museum until the year
1857. The fossils were then severed from this incongruous
connection, and placed in a separate department to which
the name of “Geology” was given.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The result is that
there are two distinct zoological and botanical collections in
the building, one containing the remains of the animals
and plants which lived through successive ages of the world’s
history from the earliest dawn of life down to close upon the
present time, and the other including those living at the
particular period in which we dwell. Notwithstanding the
objections which may be urged against this separation, it prevails
largely in museums, and (owing to certain conveniences, as
well as to the difficulty and expense of rearranging extensive
collections and reorganising the staff in charge of them) will
probably be retained for some time to come. It should, however,
be mentioned that a few specimens illustrating some of the more
important extinct forms have been intercalated among the recent
Mammals and Reptiles; while, conversely, skeletons and other
specimens of recent animals have been introduced among the
fossil Vertebrates in the Geological Department. Again, the
more important remains of extinct Cetaceans are now shown
in the Whale-Room, and some of the specimens of recent
Elephants, as well as all the Sea-Cows, in the Geological
Department.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory Collection.</div>

<p>Besides the five Departments, into which the collection is
divided for the purposes of custody and administration, each
of which is under the charge of an officer styled “Keeper”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
and a staff of Assistants, there is a sixth, under the supervision
of the Director, and arranged in the Central Hall, some of the
specimens in which are intended to serve as an introduction
to those exhibited in the others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The specimens all arranged in three series.</div>

<p>Inclusive of the last-named collection, the whole of the
specimens contained in the Museum, whether Animal, Vegetable,
or Mineral, are arranged in the three following distinct
series, as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory or Elementary Series.</div>

<p>I. An Elementary or Introductory Series, by which the
study of every group should commence. In this series, limited,
so far as the cases in the Central Hall are concerned, to
Vertebrated Animals and Botany, the leading features of the
structure, and, so far as may be, the development of the various
parts of some of the more typical members of each group, are
demonstrated in a simple manner, and the terms used in describing
and defining them explained by means of illustrative
examples. This idea is carried out in the Department of
Minerals in a series of cases placed on the north or left-hand
side of the gallery containing the rest of the collection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exhibited Systematic Series.</div>

<p>II. The Exhibited Systematic Series, in which the more
important types of animals, plants, or minerals are shown,
by means of specimens, arranged in a systematic manner; or
one which exhibits, so far as may be, their natural relations
to each other. Classification is an important feature in this
series, which properly should be so extensive and so arranged
as to enable visitors to the Museum, without recourse to
assistance from the officials, to find every well-known and
markedly distinct type of animal, plant, or mineral, and
satisfy themselves about, at least, its external characters. In
practice, with the amount of space available, and the resources
at the disposal of the authorities, it has, however, been found
impracticable to carry out this ideal in anything like its
entirety, and in most instances only a selection of specimens
is in consequence exhibited.</p>

<p>While the two series above mentioned have for their
object the <em>diffusion</em> of scientific knowledge, the next ministers
mainly to its <em>advancement</em>, so that between them the
twofold object of a National Museum of Natural History is
carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reserve or Study Systematic Series.</div>

<p>III. The Reserve or Study Systematic Series contains the
exceedingly numerous specimens (in many groups the great
bulk of the collection) showing the minute distinctions required
for working out the problems of variation according to age,
sex, season and locality, for fixing the limits of geographical
distribution, or determining the range in geological time:
distinctions which, in most cases, can only be appreciated
when the specimens are kept under such conditions as to admit
of ready and close examination and comparison. It is to this
part of the collection that naturalists resort to compare and
name the animals and plants collected in exploring expeditions,
to work out natural-history problems, and generally to advance
the knowledge of science. In fact, these reserve collections,
occupying comparatively little space, kept up at relatively small
cost, and visited by comparatively few persons, constitute, from
a scientific point of view, the most important part of the Museum;
for by their means new knowledge is obtained, which, given forth
to the world in the form of memoirs and books, is ultimately
diffused over a far wider area than that influenced even by the
exhibited portions of the Museum. Indeed, without the means
of study afforded by the reserve series, the order displayed in
the arrangement of the exhibition galleries, and the instruction
which may be gleaned from the same, would not be possible.</p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that if all the specimens
required for enlarging the boundaries of knowledge were
displayed in the public galleries, so that each could be distinctly
seen, a museum many times larger than the present one
would not suffice to contain them; the specimens themselves
would be inaccessible to those capable of deriving instruction
from their examination, while, owing to the effects of exposure
to light upon preserved natural objects, many would lose their
chief characteristics. This portion of the collection must, in
fact, be treated as are the books in a library and used for
consultation and reference by accredited students.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>In some parts of the Museum the reserve collections are
contained in drawers beneath the cases in which the corresponding
exhibited portion is placed. This applies principally
to the fossil specimens, the shells, and the minerals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
The reserve birds and insects have special rooms devoted to
them, and the extensive series of reptiles, fishes, and other
animals preserved in spirit is kept, for the purpose of
safety, in a separate building behind the Museum. In the
Botanical Department the reserve collections are kept in the
well-known form of an Herbarium, or <i>Hortus siccus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supplementary Collections.</div>

<p>The great bulk of the specimens being arranged in these
three series, supplementary collections for facilitating the study
of the distribution of animals and plants in space and in time
would be advantageous. The first, constituting a geographical
series, might show by illustrative examples the leading characteristics
of the fauna and flora of each great region of the
earth’s surface; the second, or palæontological series, would
give examples of the fossil remains found most abundantly in
each formation, arranged so far as may be in chronological order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geographical.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Geological.</div>

<p>The only attempt hitherto made at exhibiting a geographical
series in the Museum is the collection of terrestrial and fresh-water
vertebrated animals of the British Isles, arranged in the
pavilion at the west end of the bird gallery. It would be
difficult in the present building to find room for other geographical
collections, however interesting and instructive.
With regard to palæontological collections, although the specimens
in the Department of Geology, so called, are mainly
arranged not geologically, or according to stratigraphical position,
but according to their natural affinities, yet, in many
cases, it has been found convenient to adopt a mixed arrangement,
the specimens within each large natural group being
classified according to the sequence in age of the strata in
which they were buried. Such an arrangement, however, is
only applicable to the fossils of a particular region, owing to
the difficulties in accurately determining the correspondence in
age of formations occurring in distant parts of the earth’s
surface; hence a large and varied palæontological collection,
such as that of the British Museum, is best arranged in the
main upon a systematic or zoological and botanical basis. A
limited series showing the more characteristic British rock-formations
with their included fossil remains, placed in
chronological sequence, is arranged in one of the galleries of
the Geological Department.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="DESCRIPTION_OF" class="vspace wspace"><span id="c15">DESCRIPTION OF
THE MUSEUM AND ITS CONTENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On entering the Museum, the visitor should bear in mind that
the principal front faces the south, so that he will be looking
due north, with the east on his right, and the west on his left
hand.</p>

<p>It must also not be forgotten that a museum in a state of
active growth is continually receiving additions as well as
undergoing changes in the arrangement of its contents, and since
these often occur faster than new editions of the Guide can be
produced, there may be variations in the positions of some of
the specimens from those here given.</p>

<h3 id="c15a"><span class="smcap">The Central Hall.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Statues and Cases in the Central Hall.</div>

<p>On entering the hall the visitor will notice the bronze statue of
the late Sir Richard Owen, K.C.B., Superintendent of the Natural
History Departments of the British Museum (1856–1884). It is
the work of Mr. T. Brock, R.A., and was placed in the Museum
on March 17th, 1897. To the right of this is a marble statue of
the late Professor T. H. Huxley, sculptured by Mr. E. Onslow
Ford, R.A., which was unveiled on April 28th, 1900. In the
first bay on the left is a bust, by Mr. Brock, of the late Sir W. H.
Flower, Director of the Natural History Departments of the
British Museum from 1884 to 1898. Most of the cases placed
on the floor of the hall illustrate general laws or points of interest
in natural history which do not come appropriately for illustration
within the systematic collections of the departmental series.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pigeons illustrating Variation under Domestication.</div>

<p>One group, in a case near the entrance to the hall, on the
right, shows the great variation to which a species may become
subject under the influence of domestication, as illustrated by
examples of the best-marked breeds of Pigeons, all derived by
selection from the wild Rock-Dove (<i>Columba livia</i>), specimens
of which are shown at the top of the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fowls and Canaries illustrating Variation under Domestication.</div>

<p>In the corresponding case on the left are further illustrations
of the same subject. A pair of red Jungle Fowl (<i>Gallus
bankiva</i>, or <i>G. ferrugineus</i>) of India represents the species from
which the breeds of Domesticated Fowls are generally considered
to have been derived. As examples of extreme
modifications in opposite directions produced by selection, are
exhibited the Japanese Long-tailed Fowls, in which some of
the feathers (tail-coverts) attain a length of nine feet, and
specimens of a breed in which the tail is absent. There is
also shown a group of Fowls living wild in the woods of the
Fiji Islands, which are descendants from domesticated birds
introduced in the eighteenth century. A pair of Cochin Fowls
is exhibited in the same case to display development in point
of size and in the abundance of feathers on the limbs; while a
pair of white “Silkies” illustrates a modification of the plumage,
accompanied by a rudimentary condition of the tail-feathers.
The pair of Coloured Dorkings exemplifies a breed cultivated
in England.</p>

<p>A series of Canaries is shown in a case in the archway
leading from the east side of the central hall to the north hall,
as an example of a late addition to domesticated animals, these
birds having been first imported into Europe from the Canary
Islands in the early part of the sixteenth century. Specimens
are exhibited of the wild birds, and of some of the modifications
produced by selection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruffs and Reeves, illustrating Changes of Plumage according to Sex and Season.</div>

<p>A case placed to the north of the one containing Fowls
illustrates a remarkable instance of external differences in the
two sexes and changes in plumage at different seasons, not
under the influence of domestication. The birds in it belong
to one species, the Ruff (<i>Pavoncella</i>, or <i>Machetes</i>, <i>pugnax</i>), of
which the female is called Reeve; a member of the Plover
family (<i>Charadriidæ</i>). In the upper division of the case are
shown the eggs, newly-hatched young, and young males and
females in the first autumn plumage; as well as adult males
and females in winter, when both sexes are exactly alike
in colour and distinguishable externally by size alone. The
large group occupying the lower part of this case consists of
adult birds in the plumage assumed in the breeding time
(May and June). In the female the only alteration from
the winter state is a darker and richer colouring, but in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
males there is a special growth of elongated feathers about the
head and neck, constituting the “ruff” from which the bird
derives its name. In addition to this peculiarity, another,
rare among wild animals, may be observed, namely, striking
diversity of colour in different individuals. Of the twenty-three
specimens shown no two are entirely alike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wild Ducks illustrating Seasonal Change of Plumage.</div>

<p>Next in order stands a case displaying the variations,
according to season and age, in the plumage of the Wild Duck,
or Mallard (<i>Anas boscas</i>). The most noticeable feature in the
plumage-changes is the assumption in summer by males of an
“eclipse-plumage,” resembling the one worn by females at all
seasons. At other times the males are more brilliantly coloured
than their partners. The eclipse-plumage corresponds to the
winter, or non-breeding, dress of other birds which have a
seasonal change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adaptation of Colour to surrounding Conditions.</div>

<p>On the same side of the hall follow two cases illustrating
the adaptation of the colour of animals to their natural surroundings,
by means of which they are rendered less conspicuous
to their enemies or their prey. The first contains a
specimen of a Mountain or Variable Hare (the common species
of the north of Europe), a Stoat, and a Weasel, together with
some Willow-Grouse and Ptarmigan, as well as an Arctic Fox,
in their summer dresses. All were obtained in Norway, and show
the general harmony of their colouring at this season with that
of the rocks and plants among which they live. The second case
displays examples of the same animals obtained from the same
country in winter, when the ground was covered with snow.
Such striking changes as these only occur in latitudes and
localities where the differences between the general external
conditions in the different seasons are extreme, where the snow
disappears in summer and remains on the ground during most
of the winter. Even some of the species here shown do not
habitually turn white in the less severe winters of their southern
range, as the Stoat in England and the Variable Hare in
Ireland. A few permanent inhabitants of still more northern
regions, where the snow remains throughout the year, such as
the Polar Bear, Alaskan Bighorn Sheep, Greenland Falcon,
and Snowy Owl, retain the white dress throughout the year.
The whiteness of these animals must not be confounded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
<i>albinism</i>, or whiteness occurring in individuals of species
normally of a different colour, which is illustrated in a case
on the other side of the hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protective Resemblance of Desert Animals to their Surroundings.</div>

<p>The case on the east side of the hall nearest the great
staircase contains examples of conformity of general style of
colouring to surrounding conditions, as exemplified by some of
the commoner Birds, Mammals, and Reptiles of the Egyptian
desert, placed on the stones and sand amid which they habitually
dwell. The advantage of this colouring in concealing
the herbivorous species from their enemies, and in enabling the
carnivorous to approach their prey unperceived, is obvious. Many
excellent cases of concealment by adaptation to surroundings,
especially in eggs and young Birds, may be seen among the
groups in the Bird-gallery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mimicry.</div>

<p>More special modifications for the same purpose are shown in
the adjacent bay on the east side of the hall by Insects which
closely resemble the objects, such as leaves, twigs, etc.,
among which they dwell. The close imitation of a dead leaf,
presented by the Leaf-Butterfly (<i>Callima inachis</i>), when its wings
are closed, could not be surpassed. In a further stage of the
same condition, called “Mimicry,” the object resembled, or
mimicked, is another living animal, belonging to a different
species, family, or even order. The resemblance in these instances
is also believed to be for protection, or to be in some way advantageous
to the animal in which it occurs. We know, however,
so little of the habits and life-history of animals in a state of
nature that many of the purposes supposed to be served by
particular colours or appearances can only be regarded at
present as conjectural. Whatever be the real explanation, the
facts shown by the specimens in this bay are very curious, and
worthy of careful consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Group illustrating Albinism.</div>

<p>The next case on the east side of the middle of the hall
contains a series of specimens illustrating <i>albinism</i>, a condition
in which the pigment, or colouring matter, usually present in
the skin, hair, or feathers, and giving the characteristic hue,
is absent. Individuals in this condition occur among many
animals of various kinds, and are called “<i>albinos</i>.” In some of
the specimens shown in the case the albinism is complete,
but in many it is partial, the absence of colouring matter being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
limited to certain portions of the surface. Other examples of
complete or partial albinism are shown in the North Hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Group illustrating Melanism.</div>

<p>The adjacent case shows examples of the opposite condition
called <i>melanism</i>, depending upon an excess of dark colouring
matter or pigment in the skin and its appendages, such as hair,
feathers, etc., beyond what is commonly met with in the species.
This is by no means so frequent as albinism. A black Leopard
in the middle of the case is a good illustration. This is not a
distinct species, but merely an individual variety of the common
Leopard, born from parents of the normal colour. A black
Bullfinch is introduced as an example of acquired melanism,
this bird having turned black in captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Group illustrating Intermediate Forms in Nature.</div>

<p>Another group shows that two forms of Crows which
appear quite distinct, and, judged by their external
characters, might be regarded as different species, may
in a state of nature unite, and produce hybrid offspring.
In the same case is exhibited a series of Goldfinches
to show a complete gradation between birds of different colouring,
which have been regarded as different species. Both
these examples may by some naturalists be considered instances,
not of the crossing of distinct species, but of “dimorphism,” or
the occurrence of a single species in nature in two different
phases. From whatever point of view they may be regarded,
they illustrate the difficulty of defining and limiting the
meaning of the term “species,” of such constant use in
natural history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mosquitoes and Tsetse-Flies.</div>

<p>In the middle line of the hall are placed cases containing
greatly enlarged models of certain Insects concerned in the
spread of disease, such as Mosquitoes or Gnats (<a href="#fig_3">figs. 3</a> and <a href="#fig_3">4</a>),
a House-Fly, Tsetse-Fly (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>), and Plague-Flea; also still
more enlarged gelatine models of mammalian blood-corpuscles,
showing the parasites by which they are infested in the
diseases respectively communicated by means of Mosquitoes
and Tsetses. Models of the parasites themselves are also shown
(<a href="#fig_5">figs. 5</a> and <a href="#fig_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>Malaria, or ague, is a disease caused by extremely minute
parasites which live in the red corpuscles of the blood.
Formerly malaria was believed to be contracted by merely
breathing the air of marshy districts, but it is now proved
that the parasites are transmitted from man to man by the
“bite,” or rather “stab,” of a Mosquito or Gnat. The Common
Mosquito or Stabbing Gnat (<i>Culex pipiens</i>), <a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>, does not
transmit the malaria-parasite; the Spot-winged Mosquitoes
(<a href="#fig_3">fig. 4</a>) of the genus <i>Anopheles</i>, abundant in England and
nearly all parts of the world, being the carriers. The parasite
multiplies not only in the human blood, but in the stomach
and tissues of the Gnat—as shown in the models (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>Tsetse-Flies are African blood-sucking Flies, with the mouth-parts
adapted for piercing the skins of wild and domesticated
mammals, human beings, and even crocodiles. The blood of some
of the larger African animals is sometimes infected with a microscopic
parasite (<a href="#fig_6">fig. 6</a>), which, if sucked up by Tsetse-Flies when
feeding, and subsequently introduced by them into the veins
of domesticated animals such as horses and cattle, produces
the fatal <i>nagana</i>, or Tsetse-Fly disease. Sleeping-sickness in
man is caused in a similar manner, and is conveyed from
infected to healthy individuals by two kinds of Tsetse-Fly,
including that of which an enlarged model, 28 times (linear)
natural size, is exhibited. The parasites and the red blood-corpuscles
are enlarged 6,000 diameters.</p>

The House-Fly—<i>see</i> enlarged models of the perfect insect
and its preliminary stages,—although not provided with a
piercing proboscis, and consequently incapable of biting, sometimes
plays an important part in spreading deadly diseases, such
as cholera and enteric (typhoid) fever. In this case the disease-causing
organisms are carried by the insect either in its
intestine or adherent to the outer surface of its body, and thus
House-Flies may spread disease by contaminating food.</p>

<p>Plague, which is a disease of rats and a few other rodents,
especially the bobac Marmot, is communicated to man by
the bite of the flea known as <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>, one of
several species of fleas with which rats are infested. When a
rat dies, the fleas that it has been harbouring seek another
host, and may bite human beings, in which case, if the rat
itself was suffering from the disease, an epidemic of plague may
be the result. The

<div class="sidenote">African Elephant.</div>

<p>In the middle line of the hall is placed a magnificent

from Rhodesia, standing about 11 feet 4 inches in height. The
skull of the same individual is mounted on a stand below. Near
by are exhibited three tusks, the largest of which measures
10 feet 2½ inches in length. On the north wall, on either side of
the Darwin statue, are mounted two African Elephant heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bays or Alcoves round the Hall.</div>

<p>Most of the bays or alcoves round the hall, five on each
side, are (with the exception of the one at the north end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the right side) devoted to the Introductory or Elementary
Collection, designed to illustrate the more important points in
the structure of certain types of animal and plant life, and
the terms used in describing them. This has been called the
“Index Museum,” as it was thought at one time that it would
form a sort of epitome or index of the general collections in the
galleries. It is now mainly restricted to a display of the leading
structural features in Vertebrated Animals and in Plants.
The space being limited, the number of specimens is necessarily
restricted. In examining this collection the visitor should
follow each case in the usual order of reading a book, from left
to right, and carefully study the printed explanatory labels,
to which the specimens are intended to serve as illustrations.</p>

<p class="hang">The skull and tusks seen in the foreground are those of the stuffed specimen,

<p>The bays on the west side (left-hand on entering the hall) are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
devoted to the Vertebrata, or Animals possessing a “backbone.”
In Nos. I and II are shown the characters of the Mammals,
which form the highest modification of this type; the wall-cases
of No. I containing specimens of the bony framework (internal
skeleton).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay I. Skeleton of Mammals.</div>

<p>In the first case (south side of the recess) may be seen a
complete skeleton of a good example of the class—a Baboon
Monkey, with the bones laid out on a tablet, and their names
affixed. Below is a skeleton of the same animal articulated, or
with the bones in their natural relation to each other, and also
named. By examining these two specimens an idea may be
obtained of the general framework of the bodies of animals of
this class. In other parts of the case are exhibited various
modifications of the skeleton to suit different conditions of life.</p>

<p>1. Man, showing a skeleton adapted for the upright posture.</p>

<p>2. A Bat, or flying Mammal, in which, by the great elongation
of the fingers, the fore-limbs are converted into wings
(<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>), supporting a web of skin stretched between them.</p>

<p>3. A Sloth, in which the tips of both limbs are reduced to
mere hooks, by the aid of which the creature hangs back-downwards
from the boughs of the trees among which it passes
its entire existence.</p>

<p>4. The Baboon serves as an example of an animal walking on
all four limbs in the “plantigrade” position, i.e., with the whole of
the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet applied to the
ground.</p>

<p>5. A small species of Antelope shows the characteristic form
of a running animal, in which the limbs perform no office but
that of supporting the body on the ground. This animal
stands on the tips of the toes of its elongated, slender feet in
the “digitigrade” fashion.</p>

<p>6. A Porpoise, adapted solely for swimming in the water.
The fore-limbs are converted into flattened paddles, and the
hind-limbs are entirely absent, their function being performed
by the tail. The rudimentary pelvic bones are preserved.</p>

<p>The rest of the case is occupied by details of the skull in some
of its principal modifications. At the top are diagrams of the
structure of bone and cartilage as shown by the microscope.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the wall-case on the opposite (north) side of the bay the
study of the skeleton of Mammals is continued by illustrations
of the structure of the limbs. At the top of the case is a
diagram showing the correspondence of the hand and the foot
in their complete typical form, with the names applied to the
different bones. The series of specimens below shows the principal
deviations actually occurring from this typical condition,
which, as may be seen, is very nearly preserved in the human
hand. One series shows some of the stages of modification for
special purpose (specialisation) by which a typical five-fingered
hand becomes converted into the single-toed fore-foot of the
Horse; while another series ends with the fore-foot of the
Ruminants, sometimes, but erroneously, called a “cloven hoof,”
in which only two toes remain. Similar changes are shown in
the toes of the hind-foot, illustrating the same common plan
running through infinite modifications in detail, enabling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
organ to perform such a variety of purposes, and to exhibit
such diversity of outward appearance. The existence of this
common plan is now generally regarded as due to inheritance
from a common ancestor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teeth of Mammals.</div>

<p>The central case of the bay contains a collection illustrating
the principal characters of the teeth of Mammals.
Its inspection should commence at the north-east corner, where
the visitor will find himself after completing the survey of the
specimens of skeletons in the wall-cases. In the first division
are placed specimens showing the general characters of
teeth, their form, the different tissues of which they are
composed, the two great types of dentition in Mammals,
<i>homœodont</i> and <i>heterodont</i>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> the names and serial correspondence
of the different teeth, and their development and succession.
The principal modifications of teeth according to function are
next shown by examples of forms adapted for fish-eating, flesh-eating,
insect-eating, grass-eating, etc. The remainder of
the case is taken up by examples of the dentition of the
families of Mammals arranged in order, and prepared so as
to display not only the shape of the crowns, but also the
number and character of the roots by which they are
implanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay II. Classification of Mammals.</div>

<p>In bay No. II the two wall-cases contain a collection arranged
to show in a serial manner the orders and sub-orders
of existing Mammals, by examples selected to illustrate the
predominating characters by which these are distinguished. A
brief popular account of the characteristics of the group, and a
map showing its geographical distribution, are placed with
each. This is intended to serve not only for an introduction
to the study of the class by visitors to the museum, but also
as a guide to a method of arrangement which may be adopted
in smaller institutions.</p>

<p>Among the illustrations of the order <i>Primates</i> is placed the
skeleton of a young Chimpanzee dissected by Dr. Tyson,
which formed the subject of his work on the “Anatomy of a
Pigmie,” published in 1699, the earliest scientific description
of any Man-like Ape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Skin of Mammals.</div>

<p>The central case of this bay contains illustrations of the
outer covering or skin and its modifications in the class
of Mammals, divided into the following sections:</p>

<p>1. Expansion of skin to aid in locomotion, as the webs
between the fingers of swimming and flying animals, the parachutes
of flying animals.</p>

<p>2. The development of bony plates in the skin, found among
Mammals only in the Armadillos and their allies. The cast
of a section of the tail of a gigantic extinct species
(<i>Glyptodon</i>) shows a bony external as well as an internal
skeleton.</p>

<p>3. The outer covering modified into true scales, much resembling
in structure the nails of the human hand. This occurs
in only one family of Mammals, the Pangolins, or <i>Manidæ</i>.</p>

<p>4. Hair in various forms, including bristles and spines. The
two kinds of hair composing the external clothing of most
Mammals, the long, stiffer outer hair, and the short, soft under-fur,
are shown by various examples.</p>

<p>5. The special epidermal appendages found in nearly all
Mammals on the ends of the fingers and toes, called according
to the various forms they assume, nails, claws, or hoofs.</p>

<p>6. The one or two unpaired horns of the Rhinoceroses, shown
by sections to consist of a solid mass of hair-like epidermic fibres.</p>

<p>7. The horns of Oxen, Goats, and Antelopes, each consisting
of a hollow conical sheath of horn, covering a permanent
projection of the frontal bone (the horn-core).</p>

<p>8. The antlers of Deer, forming solid, bony, and generally
branched projections, covered during growth with soft hairy
skin, and in most cases shed and renewed annually.</p>

<p>On the wall is arranged a series of antlers of an individual
Stag or Red Deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>), grown and shed (except the
last) in thirteen successive years, showing the changes which
took place in their size and form, and the development of the
branches, or tines, in each year. In old age the number of
these tines tends to diminish.</p>

<p>On the north side of the table-case are shown dissections
of the principal internal organs of Mammals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay III. General structure of Birds.</div>

<p>Bay No. III is devoted to the class of Birds. An Albatross
(<i>Diomedea exulans</i>) mounted with the wings expanded shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the most important characters by which a Bird is externally
distinguished from other animals. The body is clothed
with feathers, which (in the majority of Birds), by their great
size and special arrangement upon the fore-limbs, enable
these to act as organs of flight. The mouth is in the form of a
horny beak. A nestling Albatross shows that at this stage of its
existence the bird is not clothed with ordinary feathers, but with
soft down, which serves to keep the body warm, although it
confers no power of flight. An Emu and an Apteryx in the lower
compartment of the case display the exceptional condition (found
only in a comparatively few members of the class) of Birds with
wings so small as to be concealed beneath the general feathery
covering of the body, and quite useless. In the Penguins,
of which two species are shown in the case, the wings are
reduced to the condition of fins, and are serviceable only for
progress through water.</p>

<p>In the first wall-case the principal features of the skeleton of
the class are shown. Sections of bones exhibit the large air-cavities
within; a complete skeleton of an Eagle, with the bones separated
and named, and mounted skeletons of the Ostrich, Penguin,
Pelican, Vulture, Night-Parrot, Fowl, etc., show the chief modifications
of the skeleton. The Apteryx possesses the smallest,
and the Frigate-bird the longest bones of the wing, the correspondence
of which can be readily traced by means of the
labels attached to them. The under surfaces of the skulls of
various birds are shown with the different bones coloured to
indicate their limits and relations; these are followed by a
series of the different types of sternum or breast-bone.</p>

<p>The second wall-case contains further illustrations of the
anatomy of Birds. In the left-hand part a series of wings of
Birds displays the form characteristic of different groups;
while above them are a few of the different types of tails,
supplementing the series of tails in the table-case. Very
instructive is a series of skins of white chickens of the same
brood at different ages, displaying the gradual replacement of
the down by the adult plumage.</p>

<p>The table-case in the middle of the bay contains illustrations
of the external characters, the beak, the feathers, and the tail, as
well as of the fore and hind limbs, or wings and feet. By the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
aid of the explanatory labels, the essential characters and
the principal modifications of all these parts may easily be
followed.</p>

<p>Two cases on the wall in the vestibule leading to the Fish
Gallery illustrate the chief modifications of the eggs of Birds,
and their differences in structure, number, form, size, texture of
surface, and colour. On the side of the main staircase opposite
are specimens illustrating the parasitic nesting habits of certain
Cuckoos and various other Birds; while near by is a remarkably
fine series of the eggs of Cuckoos with those of the Birds among
which they were respectively deposited. On the opposite (east)
side of the staircase the visitor will find a case showing the
remarkable variation in colouring and markings displayed by
the eggs of the Guillemot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay IV. General structure of Reptiles and Amphibians.</div>

<p>The fourth bay on the west side of the hall exhibits the
leading peculiarities in the structure of Reptiles and Amphibians.
Owing to the large number of groups in the former
class now extinct, many fossil specimens, or plaster reproductions
of the same, are shown. The wall-case on the south side
of this bay illustrates the different ordinal groups of Reptiles—living
and extinct. Very instructive are the skeletons of
Tortoises and Turtles, showing the relations of the vertebræ
and limb-bones to the bony part of the shell. Lizards and
Snakes are mostly represented by coloured casts. The extinct
Dinosaurs are represented by a small-sized model of <i>Iguanodon</i>,
together with a photograph of the skeleton and a plaster-cast
of the bones of the hind-foot showing the three toes.</p>

<p>The adjacent side of the table-case shows the modifications
of the backbone, or vertebral column, of the ribs, and of the
limbs, in the different groups of the class. Specially noticeable
are examples of five types of Skink-like Lizards, exhibiting the
gradual diminution in the size of the limbs and their final
disappearance.</p>

<p>The opposite, or north, side of the table-case displays the
different modifications of the skull and teeth of living and
extinct Reptiles. In some, like Crocodiles and Ichthyosaurs,
the jaws are armed with a full series of sharply pointed teeth,
while in others, like the Tortoises and Turtles, they are devoid
of teeth and encased in horn. Very remarkable is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
approximation to a carnivorous mammalian type presented by
the dentition of some of the extinct mammal-like Reptiles, or
Theromorphs, and equally noticeable are the palatal crushing
teeth of certain other extinct Reptiles known as <i>Placodus</i> and
<i>Cyamodus</i>. The peculiar dentition of the New Zealand Tuatera,
and likewise that of its extinct European and Indian ally
<i>Hyperodapedon</i> (<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>), are also shown.</p>

The Giant
Salamander of
Japan (<i>Megalobatrachus</i>

Newts, Salamanders,

from the caves
of Carniola; as also
are the so-called
Cœcilians, or Apoda,
which have the
habits and, in some
degree, the appearance
of large worms.
Special specimens
exhibit the structure
of the extinct
Labyrinthodonts, in
which the hinder
half of the skull is
completely roofed
over by bone; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the teeth in many instances exhibit a curious in-folded
arrangement from which the group derives its name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay V. Structure of Fishes.</div>

<p>The last bay (No. V) on the west side of the Central Hall is
devoted to the display of the form and structure of Fishes.</p>

<p>The wall-case on the left side of this bay exhibits the external
form of several characteristic types of Fishes, such as the Pike,
Cod, Turbot, Dog-fish, and Skate, with the names of the various
fins affixed. A striking specimen is the skeleton—mainly cartilaginous—of
the Great Blue Shark (<i>Carcharodon rondeletii</i>),
fig. 10, which occupies the greater portion of this case. It
should be noted that, as in all Sharks and Rays, the upper jaw
does not correspond with that of the higher Vertebrates; and
particular attention should be devoted to the structure and
arrangement of the arches supporting the gills.</p>

<p>In the south side of the table-case in this bay are shown a
number of dissections, mounted in spirit, displaying the different
types of skeletal structure presented by the fins in various
groups of Fishes. One of the most remarkable of these types
occurs in <i>Ceratodus forsteri</i>, the Queensland Lung-fish, in which
the skeleton of the fin consists of a central jointed rod, from
each side of which diverge narrower jointed rods. Alongside are
specimens showing special modifications of certain fins, as in
the Flying Fish (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>) and Flying Gurnard (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 12</a>), for the
purpose of sustaining the body in the air, or, as in <i>Pentanemus</i>,
to serve as organs of touch. Specimens of the West Indian
Goby and the Lump-Sucker show modifications of the pelvic
fins in connection with a sucker on the lower surface of the
body; while other preparations display the pectoral (<i>Doras</i>) and
pelvic fins (<i>Monocentris</i>) reduced to the condition of saw-like
spines.</p>

<p>The structure of the skull of Fishes is illustrated in another
part of the same side of this case. From this the visitor may
learn how the primitive cartilaginous skull of the Sharks
(<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>), Rays, Chimæras, and Lung-fishes has been gradually
modified, by the addition of superficial sheathing-bones, into the
bony skull of modern Fishes, such as the Cod and Perch.</p>

<p>The north side of the table-case in bay V is mainly devoted
to the display of the different types of scales, spines, and teeth
found among Fishes. In one corner are the enamelled “ganoid”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
scales of the modern American Bony Pike (<i>Lepidosteus</i>) and the
African Bichir (<i>Polypterus</i>) alongside those of certain extinct
forms. A scale of the Tarpon, or King-of-the-Herrings, illustrates
the largest development in point of size of the modern
“cycloid” type. Spines of the Porcupine-fish show an extreme
development of this kind of structure. Diagrams and spirit-preparations
illustrate the mode of attachment and succession
of fish-teeth. A large series of the teeth of Sharks and Rays
displays the gradual passage from those of the ordinary
pointed form to others arranged in a pavement-like manner
and adapted solely for crushing. Both types occur in the
Port Jackson Shark (<a href="#fig_13">fig. 13</a>), but those of some Rays are
solely of the pavement modification. Very remarkable is
the dental structure in the Parrot-fish. The west end of this
side of the case shows the various modifications assumed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
teeth of the modern Bony Fishes; among which, as exemplified
by the Wrasse, teeth are developed on the bones of the throat,
as well as on those of the jaws. Throughout this case
specimens, or models, of the teeth of extinct Fishes are placed
side by side with those of their nearest living relatives.</p>

<p>The wall-case on the north side of this bay shows the
history of the development of various Fishes, together with the
form and structure of the gills, brain, heart, digestive system,
and other organs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lancelet.</div>

<p>A small case affixed to the pillar at the entrance of the fifth
bay illustrates the structure of the Lancelet (<i>Branchiostoma</i>,
or <i>Amphioxus</i>), by the aid of spirit-specimens, enlarged models,
and coloured diagrams. One of the most remarkable features in
the structure of this strange and primitive little creature is the
outer cavity enclosing the part of the body which contains the
large and complex pharynx. The Lancelet was formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
included among the Fishes, but is now accorded the rank of
a class (Cephalochorda) to itself.</p>

<p>Leaving bay VI, next the principal staircase on the east side
of the central hall, which is devoted to illustrations of heredity,
especially in relation to the Mendelian theory, and to modes of
Flight in Vertebrates and Insects, we pass on to a table-case
assigned to the illustration of “Mimicry” and kindred phenomena.
Most of the examples shown occur among Insects;
but one example among Mammals and a second in Birds are
illustrated. Very striking is a coloured sketch showing a group
of red and black caterpillars from Singapore grouped side by
side on the stem of a plant so as to present a remarkable
similarity to a succulent fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay VIII.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bay IX.</div>

<p>In bay VIII, on the eastern side of the central hall, is displayed
an exhibition illustrating trees, native to or grown in
Britain. The winter and summer states are indicated by
photographs, and the foliage, flowers, fruits, seedlings, and
texture of wood and bark by specimens, models, and drawings.
Bays IX and X are intended to illustrate the general characters
of the great groups of the Vegetable Kingdom. Bay IX, in
course of arrangement, is devoted to the Cryptogams (Ferns,
Mosses, Fungi, Seaweeds, and Lichens).</p>

<p>At the back of the bay is a fine polished section of a buttress
from the base of the Tapang (<i>Abauria excelsa</i>), the largest tree
in Borneo, which attains a height of 250 feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bay X. Seed-bearing Plants.</div>

<p>The last bay (No. X) is devoted to the Seed-bearing Plants,
which are characterised by the formation of a seed—the result
of the fertilisation of an ovule by the male cell which is
developed in the pollen. The series begins on the left hand
side with the Pteridosperms, an extinct group combining the
characters of Ferns and Seed-plants and forming a link between
them. Then follow the Gymnosperms (Cycads, Pines, Firs,
etc.), in which the seed is borne naked on an open scale which
generally forms, with others like it, the characteristic cone.
Certain points in the development of pollen and ovule recall
similar stages in the Fern group, and indicate that the Gymnosperms
stand nearer to the Cryptogams than do the Angiosperms,
the other and larger group of Seed-plants. The Gymnosperms
are also the older group, and contain many extinct forms. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the Angiosperms the seed is enclosed in the fruit, and in the
development of pollen and ovule almost all traces of a cryptogamic
ancestry have been lost; the great development of the
flower is a characteristic feature of the Angiosperms. The
arrangement of the vegetative parts of the plant is based on its
separation into root, stem, and leaf. In the right-hand wall-case
the upper series of specimens illustrates the leaf, its form,
veining, direction, the characters of its stalk and stipules, its
modification for special purposes, and its arrangement on the
stem and in the bud. Below, the stem and root are similarly
treated, and above are some anatomical drawings. The display
of the root is continued in the lower part of the opposite wall-case.
In the central case the chief types of the flower with its
parts, the fruit, and the seed are exhibited.</p>

<p>At the back of the bay is a large transverse section of the
Karri tree (<i>Eucalyptus diversicolor</i>) of Western Australia, a
species which grows to a height of 400 feet. The tree from
which the section was cut was about 200 years old when
felled.</p>

<p>The Introductory Collection of Minerals will be found in the
gallery devoted to the Mineral Department (see <a href="#c90a">p. 90</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c38"><span class="smcap">The North Hall.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Domesticated Animals,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Hybrids, and Economic Zoology.</div>

<p>The North Hall, or that portion of the building situated
to the northward of the principal staircase, is used for the
exhibition of the more important breeds of Domesticated
Animals, as well as of examples of Hybrids and other Abnormalities.
A series of specimens illustrative of Economic
Zoology is likewise temporarily placed here.</p>

<p>The examples of Domesticated Mammals include Horses,
Cattle, Sheep, Goats, Llamas, Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits. One
of the main objects of this series is to show the leading
characteristics of the well-established breeds, both British and
foreign. In addition to Domesticated Animals properly so
called, there are also exhibited examples of what may be termed
Semi-domesticated Animals, such as white or parti-coloured
Rats and Mice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
The skulls and skeletons of celebrated Horses<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> of all breeds,
including those of the Thoroughbreds “Persimmon” (presented
by His Majesty King Edward VII.), “Stockwell,” “Bend Or,”
and “Ormonde,” and of the Shire “Blaisdon Conqueror,” form
a notable feature of the series. In another case is exhibited the
dentition of the Horse at different periods of existence; while
on the opposite side of the same is illustrated the evolution of
the Horse from three-toed and four-toed ancestors, and also
certain peculiarities distinguishing the skulls of Thoroughbreds
and Arabs from those of most other breeds.</p>

<p>Among the more notable exhibits are a mounted specimen
of a Spanish Fighting Bull, which belongs to an altogether
peculiar breed, and heads of Spanish Draught Cattle, presented
by H.M. King Edward VII. Among the Sheep, attention
may be directed to the four-horned, fat-tailed, and fat-rumped
breeds, and also to the small breed from the island of Soa, as
well as the curious spiral horned Wallachian Sheep. The
so-called wild cattle of Chillingham Park are included in this
series, since they are not truly wild animals, but are descended
from a domesticated breed. The celebrated Greyhound “Fullerton”
is shown among the series of Dogs, which also comprises
examples of the Afghan Greyhound, and of the Slughi or Arab
Greyhound. Small-sized models of Cattle, Horses, Sheep, and
Pigs also form a feature of the series.</p>

<p>A hybrid between the Zebra and the Ass is shown in one of
the cases; while photographs illustrate the results of experiments
undertaken by Professor Ewart in cross-breeding between
Burchell’s Zebra and the Horse. An example of the Lion-Tiger
hybrids born many years ago in Atkins’ menagerie is likewise
shown.</p>

<p>A fine series of hybrid Ducks and hybrid Pheasants is
exhibited in the north hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Skeletons of Man and Horse.</div>

<p>Facing the visitor as he approaches the middle of the north
hall are the skeletons of a Man and of a Horse, arranged
for comparison with each other, and also to show the position
of the bones of both in relation to the external surface. In the
case of the Horse, the skin of the same animal from which the
skeleton was prepared was carefully mounted, and, when dry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
divided in the middle line; one half, lined with velvet, has been
placed behind the skeleton. In the case of the Man, the external
surface is shown by a <i>papier-maché</i> model, similarly lined and
placed in a corresponding position. As all the principal bones
of both skeletons have their names attached, a study of this
group will not only afford a lesson in comparative anatomy,
but be of practical utility to the artist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Section of “Big Tree.”</div>

<p>Against the wall dividing the north hall from the central
hall is placed a section of a very large Wellingtonia or “Big
Tree” (<i>Sequoia gigantea</i>), which was cut down in 1892 near
Fresno, in California. It is about fifteen feet in diameter, and
perfectly sound to the centre, showing distinctly 1,335 rings of
annual growth, which afford exact evidence of the age of the
tree. An instantaneous photograph, taken while the tree was
being felled, is placed near by, and shows its general appearance
when living. The height of the tree was 276 feet.</p>

<p>The exhibits of Economic Zoology at present occupy the
northern division of this hall. In the western wall-case are
specimens showing the injuries caused to trees by various insects.
The table-cases contain examples of the damage done in Britain
to fruit, roots, corn, and garden and vegetable produce, with
specimens of the insects, and hints as to methods of destruction.
There are also examples of injury done by insects abroad to
cotton, tea, coffee, etc. In the cases under the windows are
various parasites affecting man and domesticated animals.</p>

<h3 id="c40"><span class="smcap">Staircase and Corridors.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Statue of Darwin.</div>

<p>On the first landing of the great staircase, facing the centre of
the hall, is placed the seated marble statue of <span class="smcap">Charles Darwin</span>
(b. 1809, d. 1882), to whose labours the study of natural history
owes so vast an impulse. The statue was executed by Sir J. E.
Boehm, R.A., as part of the “Darwin Memorial” raised by public
subscription. It was unveiled and placed under the care of the
Trustees of the Museum on the 9th of June, 1885, when an
address was delivered on behalf of the Memorial Committee by
the late Professor Huxley, P.R.S., to which His late Majesty
King Edward VII. (then Prince of Wales), as representing the
Trustees, replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Statue of Banks.</div>

<p>Above the first landing the staircase divides into two
flights, each leading to one of the corridors which flank
the west and east sides of the hall and give access to the
galleries of the first floor of the building. Near the southern ends
of these corridors two staircases join to form a central flight
leading to the second floor. On the landing at the top is a
marble statue by Chantrey of <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Banks</span> (b. 1743,
d. 1820), who for 41 years presided over the Royal Society and
was Trustee of the Museum. His botanical collections are preserved
in the adjoining gallery, but his library of works on natural
history, also bequeathed to the Museum, remains at Bloomsbury,
where the statue, erected by public subscription in 1826, stood
until it was removed to its present situation in 1886. On the wall
above is displayed a series of unusually fine heads of Indian Big
Game Animals, bequeathed by Mr. A. O. Hume, C.B., in 1912.</p>

<p>The west, south, and east corridors contain a portion of the
collection of mounted Mammals for which there is not room in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the gallery immediately adjoining. The specimens placed here
include a large number of species of the finest African Antelopes,
animals remarkable for their beauty, for their former countless
numbers, and for their threatened extermination in consequence
of the inroads of civilized man into their domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Giraffes and Okapi.</div>

<p>In a case at the head of the staircase leading to the east
corridor are several mounted specimens of Giraffes, and near by
a skeleton of the same. Alongside the former is placed a case
containing the heads and necks, together with skulls, of the
various local races of Giraffes; while in a third are displayed
three specimens of their near ally the Okapi (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>) of the
Congo Forest, as well as a skeleton of the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Collections of Humming-Birds.</div>

<p>The collection of Humming-Birds (<i>Trochilidæ</i>) arranged and
mounted by the late Mr. John Gould, and purchased for the
Museum in 1881, is principally shown in the vestibule leading
from the hall to the Fish-gallery, but a few cases are placed on
the pillars of the staircase. Another large collection of these
birds, presented in 1913 by Mr. E. J. Balston, of Maidstone, is
exhibited in the corridor leading to the Whale-room.</p>

<h3 id="c42">WEST WING.</h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="c42b">Bird Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></div>

<p>The ground floor is entered from the west side (left hand) of
the central hall, near the main entrance of the building. The
long gallery, extending the entire length of the front of the wing
as far as the west pavilion, is assigned to the exhibited collection
of Birds, the study-series of the same group being kept in
cabinets in a room behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Systematic Series in Wall-cases.</div>

<p>The wall-cases contain mounted specimens of all the principal
genera, placed in systematic order, beginning with the Crows
and Birds of Paradise on the left hand on entering, and ending
with the Ostriches, Emus, etc., on the right.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of species exhibited in this gallery,
which form, however, but a small proportion of the different
kinds of Birds known to inhabit the globe, only a few of the more
striking can be mentioned. The various types of the Birds-of-Prey
are very fully represented: from the Condor of the
Andes, the large Sea-Eagle of Bering Strait, and the Great
Eagle-Owl of Europe (all of which are placed in separate cases),
to the Dwarf Falcon in case 53, which is not much larger
than a sparrow, and preys upon insects. Among the large group of
Perching-Birds, attention may be directed to the cases of Birds
of Paradise and Bower-Birds in the first bay on the left. In
separate cases in the sixth bay on the opposite side of the gallery
are placed skeletons of the Dodo and Solitaire, large Pigeon-like
birds with wings too small for flight, once inhabiting the
islands of Mauritius and Rodriguez, respectively, but now extinct.
Other cases on the right-hand side of the gallery are occupied
by the Game-Birds, and the Wading and Swimming Birds.
Here may be noticed a nearly complete series of the genera of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Pheasants and Pigeons, showing the various forms. Special
attention may be directed to the Great Auk (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>), from the
Northern Atlantic, which became extinct only in the last century.
Casts of the eggs (<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>) of this curious bird are also exhibited.
A case in the 7th bay contains a series of Penguins, flightless
birds which may be regarded as representing the northern
Auks and Guillemots in the southern oceans. Particularly
interesting is the great Emperor Penguin, which lays its eggs
and rears its young in winter amidst the ice of the Antarctic.
Most of the specimens exhibited were obtained during the
British Antarctic Expedition of 1839–43, under the command
of Captain Sir James Clark Ross.</p>

<p>Other noteworthy types are the Great Bustard, once an
inhabitant of England, and the Flamingos; a pair of the latter
being exhibited with their nest.</p>

<p>In the first two bays on the right side of the gallery are placed
specimens of the Ostrich group, characterised by the flat or raft-like
form of the breast-bone. Owing to the rudimentary
character of their wings, these Birds lack the power of flight.
They include the largest existing Birds, the Ostriches, Emus,
and Cassowaries, as well as the small Kiwis (<i>Apteryx</i>) of New
Zealand, together with the extinct Moas (<i>Dinornis</i>, etc.), of the
same country, and the Roc (<i>Æpyornis</i>) of Madagascar. A
fossil egg of the latter is placed alongside eggs of the existing
species of the group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Groups of British Birds and Nests.</div>

<p>Down the middle line of the gallery, as well as in many
of the bays, are placed groups showing the nesting-habits
of various species of British birds. The great value of these
groups consists in their absolute truthfulness to nature. The
surroundings are not selected by chance or from imagination,
but in every case are carefully executed reproductions of those
that were present round the individual nest. When it has been
possible, the actual rocks, trees, or grass, have been preserved,
but in cases where these could not be used, they have been
accurately modelled from nature. Great care has also been taken
in preserving the natural form and characteristic attitudes of the
Birds themselves. Among the more attractive cases are, near
the centre of the gallery, a pair of Puffins feeding their
single young one, and Black-throated Divers with their eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
in a hollow in the grass on the edge of a mountain-loch in
Sutherland. Hen-harriers—the male grey and the female brown—are
shown with their nest among the heather from the moorland
of the same county. On the left of these is a Peregrine Falcon’s
eyrie, on the ledge of a rocky cliff, containing three white downy
nestlings. Near by are various species of Ducks, notably the
Red-headed Pochard on the sedgy border of a Norfolk mere. In
the last bay but one on the right side is a nest of the Heron, in
a fir-tree, with the two old birds and three nearly fledged
young. Various species of Gulls and a particularly beautiful
group of Arctic Terns from the Shetland Islands are exhibited
in the middle line towards the west end of the gallery and in
the eighth and ninth bays. In the eighth bay on the right side
and in the adjoining passage are Plovers, Sandpipers, Snipes,
etc., some of which (especially the Ringed and Kentish
Plovers) show the wonderful adaptation of the colouring of the
eggs and young birds to their natural surroundings for the
purpose of concealment. In the second passage leading to
the Coral-gallery are Ptarmigan and Capercaillie from Scotland,
and in the adjacent part of the middle line Wood-Pigeons and
Turtle-Doves building their simple, flat nests of sticks in ivy-clad
trees. In the fourth, sixth and seventh bays on the left
are Sand-Martins and Kingfishers, showing, by means of sections
of the banks of sand or earth, the form and depth of the hole in
which the eggs are placed; and also nests of the Swift, Swallow,
and House-Martin, all in portions of human habitations.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c46">Pavilion, with British Land and Fresh-water Vertebrates.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></div>

<p>The “pavilion” at the west end of the Bird-gallery is devoted
to the exhibition of the land and fresh-water Vertebrated Animals
of the British Islands. The larger Mammals and Fishes occupy
the wall-case on the north side, which is surmounted with
horns. In the two pairs of centre cases is exhibited the series
of British Birds, supplemented by the groups, to which reference
has been made already. The wall-case on the north side of the
archway contains a group of Gannets and other sea-birds from
the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. On the opposite side are
two striking groups with the surroundings true to nature, the
one of the Golden Eagle and the other of the Buzzard, both
taken in Scotland. Other groups in the pavilion display the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Kestrel, the Peregrine Falcon, and the Merlin amid natural
surroundings. Among the Mammals, especial attention may be
directed to a case of British Hares and Rabbits. In another
case may be seen a female Badger and her young; in a third
is a group of Otters; in a fourth a vixen Fox with her cubs;
in a fifth a Mole-hill with its inhabitants; in a sixth a pair
of Martens; in a seventh Polecats and their young; while
other cases are devoted to Stoats, Weasels, Hedgehogs, Squirrels,
Rats, Mice, etc.</p>

<p>Here it may be mentioned that the animal inhabitants of any
country or district are collectively termed its “<i>fauna</i>.” The
British Islands in this respect belong to the great zoological
region called Palæarctic, or Eastern Holarctic, embracing all
Europe, the north of Africa, and the western and northern
portions of Asia. As in the case of other islands, the species
belonging to groups in which the power of locomotion is limited
to land or fresh-water are not numerous compared with those
inhabiting large continental tracts. Their numbers can only
increase under exceptional circumstances, and have a tendency
to diminish as the growth of human population and increase
of the area of cultivated land gradually reduce their
native haunts. In this way the Brown Bear, the Wolf, the
Beaver, and the Wild Boar have disappeared from Britain
within the historic period, while other species, such as the Badger,
Marten, and Wild Cat, with difficulty maintain a more or less
precarious existence. All these were originally derived from the
mainland of Europe, probably before the formation of the channel
which now separates it from Great Britain. The wider and older
channel which separates Ireland from Great Britain has been a
greater barrier to the emigration of animal life than that
between the latter and the Continent, many species (as the
Polecat, Wild Cat, Mole, Squirrel, Dormouse, Harvest-Mouse,
Water-Rat, Short-tailed Field-Mouse, Brown Hare, Roedeer,
as well as Snakes and Toads) never having crossed what is
now the Irish Sea, unless by human agency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those species that have the power of
travelling through the air or traversing the ocean are far less
fixed in their habitat; and it results from this that the list of
so-called “British Birds” receives accessions from time to time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
from stragglers which find their way from the European continent
or Asia, or even across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Slight but permanent variations from the continental type
may be recognised in many native British species, some of
the most marked among vertebrated animals being the Irish
Stoat, the Squirrel, the Red Grouse, the St. Kilda Wren, the
Coal-Tit, the Goldcrest, and several species of fresh-water
fishes, mostly belonging to the genera <i>Salmo</i> and <i>Coregonus</i>.
Some of the latter, such as the Vendace, the Gwyniad, and
their allies, of which specimens are exhibited in the wall-case
in the pavilion, have an extremely local distribution, being found
only in certain small groups of mountain lakes.</p>

<p>Of the Seals, only two species are really natives of Britain,
the Common Seal (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) and the great Grey Seal
(<i>Halichœrus grypus</i>); specimens of both these are shown in the
pavilion.</p>

<p>Those desirous of studying more minutely the characteristics
of British Mammals should examine the series of skins and

<p>Parallel with the Bird-gallery, on the north side (right on entering),
and approached by several passages, is a long narrow gallery
containing the collection of Corals and Sponges and allied types.
Commencing at the eastern end, some of the lowest forms of
animal life are exhibited in the wall-case and table-cases; they
belong to a group called <span class="smcap">Protozoa</span>, and, for the greater part, are
so minute, that they can be studied only with the microscope;
their structure is therefore illustrated chiefly by means of models
and figures. The next divisions of the gallery are occupied by the
Sponges, most conspicuous among these being a series showing
the variations of the common Bath-Sponge (cases 1 and 2), the
beautiful flinty Venus’ Flower-basket or <i>Euplectella</i> (<a href="#fig_17">fig. 17</a>),
the Japanese Glass-rope Sponge or <i>Hyalonema</i> (case 3), and the
gigantic Neptune’s Cup or <i>Poterion</i>, of which several specimens
are placed on separate stands. Special interest attaches
to the case showing the different kinds of Sponges used in
commerce.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—<span class="smcap">Brain-Coral.</span> (<i>Meandrina cerebriformis</i>).</div></div>

<p>Nearly the whole of the remainder of the gallery is given up
to Corals. In life these organisms display an immense variety
of form and colour, sometimes presenting a marvellous resemblance
to vegetable growths; but the part exhibited in the
gallery is merely the dried, hard, horny, or stony basis or supporting
skeleton, either of isolated individuals, or of colonies.
Corals are allied to the well-known Sea-anemones of the
British and other coasts; the combined skeletons of myriads of
these animals form the coral-reefs which constitute the bases
of thousands of islands in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Among
the larger reef-making species are the Brain-Corals (<i>Meandrina</i>),
one of which is shown in figure 18. Near the west
end of the gallery is placed a magnificent specimen of the
Black Coral of the Mediterranean (<i>Gerardia savalia</i>), obtained
off the coast of the island of Eubœa in the Ægean Sea.
The drawing in the case shows a magnified view of the
“animals” or polyps of this species as they appear in life.
In case 13 are specimens and drawings of the Red Coral
(<i>Corallium rubrum</i>), so largely used for ornamental purposes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
and also of the crimson Organ-pipe Coral (<i>Tubipora
musica</i>). Arranged on shelves on the south wall of the
western end of this gallery is a series of <i>Pennatulidæ</i> (Sea-pens,
Sea-rushes, or Sea-ropes) preserved in spirit. These Zoophytes
live at the bottom of the sea, with their lower ends fixed in the
sand and mud; the skeleton being never more than a straight
internal rod in addition to innumerable microscopic spicules.</p>

<p>I. The Fish-gallery is nearest to the central hall, and contains
the exhibited portion of the collection of Fishes. The
greater number of specimens, preserved in spirit, are, however,
placed for safety in a detached building outside the Museum,
where they are available for study under special regulations. The
gallery contains mounted examples, models, and skeletons of
many of the more remarkable members of the class.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—<span class="smcap">Sucker-Fish</span> (<i>Echeneis remora</i>).</div></div>

<p>The wall-cases on the east side of the gallery (right on
entering) contain the fishes with completely bony skeletons
(Teleostei); to which division belong by far the greater part of
the species now inhabiting the waters of the globe. Large and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
remarkable examples are placed in separate cases opposite to
the wall-cases. As the colours of fishes are very fugitive, and
disappear more or less completely after death, most of the
mounted examples have been painted. The fishes allied to the
Perch, Gurnard, Mackerel, Sword-Fish, Wrasse, Cod, Plaice,
Catfish, Salmon, Pike, and Eel are represented by numerous
examples. Specially noticeable, so far
as size and external form are concerned,
are the Sunfishes, <i>Orthagoriscus</i> (<a href="#fig_19">fig. 19</a>).</p>

<p>Even more strange are several of
the species of deep-sea Fishes exhibited
in a table-case in the Fish-gallery,
which live at depths where the sun’s
rays cannot penetrate, and many of
which are self-luminous. Two deep-sea
Fishes are shown in the accompanying
illustrations (<a href="#fig_20">figs. 20</a> and <a href="#fig_20">21</a>). From
another point of view, special attention
may be given to the Sucker-Fish or
Remora (<i>Echeneis remora</i>), <a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>, which
attaches itself by the sucker on
the top of its head to the bodies of
Fishes or Turtles, or to the bottom of
ships. As it attaches itself back-downwards,
the under-parts are coloured
dark while the back is light; a condition
just the reverse of that obtaining
in ordinary Fishes.</p>

the Head of a Saw-Fish.</span>
(<i>Pristis antiquorum.</i>)</div></div>

<p>The western or left side of the gallery
is devoted to the exhibition of certain
very different types of Fishes, which
were much more numerously represented
in ancient times than at present. The
majority have a cartilaginous skeleton. Among these may be
specially mentioned the Bichir of the tropical African rivers, the
Gar-Pike of North America, the Sturgeons, the Lung-Fishes
(Dipnoi) of South America, Africa, and Australia, the Chimæras,
and finally the Sharks and Rays. Among the two latter are
included the singular Hammer-headed Shark (<i>Zygœna</i>), and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Saw-Fishes (<i>Pristis</i>), which have long projecting flattened
snouts, with a row of teeth arranged something like those of a
saw on each side (<a href="#fig_23">fig. 23</a>). A remarkably large specimen from
the coast of British Guiana of a species of this group (<i>Pristis
perrotteti</i>) is exhibited. Another very small division of Fishes
comprises the Lampreys and Hags, of which a few specimens
are shown.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Basking Shark</span> (<i>Selache maxima</i>).</div></div>

<p>The largest exhibited specimen of the class is the head of a
full-grown example of the great Basking Shark (<i>Selache</i>, or
<i>Cetorhinus, maxima</i>), <a href="#fig_24">fig. 24</a>, captured on the 2nd of March, 1875,
near Shanklin, in the Isle of Wight. The length of the
entire specimen was twenty-eight feet, but, as the minute size
of the teeth indicates, it is a comparatively harmless fish. A
smaller female specimen is suspended from the roof; and
below this is placed a model of the skeleton of the same species.
Near by is a young specimen of another basking species,
the Elephant-Shark (<i>Rhinodon typicus</i>), which when adult is
said to attain a length of at least fifty feet. It inhabits the
Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p>Models of some of the more remarkable types of extinct
Fishes are exhibited in cases on the same side of the gallery.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c54">Insect Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></div>

<p>II. A small gallery is devoted to the group of Arthropoda or
Invertebrate animals with jointed limbs, such as Lobsters,
Crabs, Spiders, Centipedes, and Insects.</p>

<p>At the south end of this gallery are exhibited specimens of
Crabs and Lobsters. Among the former, special attention may
be directed to the specimens of the Giant Crab (<i>Macrocheira</i>) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Japan, and also to the Coconut Crab (<i>Birgus latro</i>), <a href="#fig_25">fig. 25</a>, which
climbs trees to feed on young cocoanuts, and is related to the
Hermit-Crabs. In the central table-cases, besides Crustacea
(Crabs, Lobsters, etc.), are displayed representative Scorpions and
Spiders, including several examples of the large Bird-eating
Spiders of South America.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Coconut Crab</span> (<i>Birgus latro</i>).</div></div>

<p>The northern half of this gallery is devoted to the exhibited
series of Insects. Next to the door on the east side are the
nests of White Ants or Termites, while on the opposite side
are some remarkable cocoons of social Caterpillars of various
Moths, and also a series of preparations showing the
metamorphoses or changes undergone by Insects as they grow
to maturity. At the sides of the gallery are models of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
galls, with drawings of the insects which cause them; and
others showing the life-histories of certain Beetles, Bees,
and Moths. Beneath a shelf, on the west side, are four
cabinets containing a collection of British Butterflies and
Moths with their caterpillars, prepared and presented by Lord
Walsingham; and near by stands a cabinet containing a
collection of the Butterflies and Moths of the British islands
formed by the late Mr. William Buckler, most of the specimens
in which were bred by him during the preparation of his
“Larvæ of British Butterflies and Moths.” Above these are
maps illustrating the geographical distribution of certain Beetles
(<i>Calosoma</i>, <i>Carabus</i>, <i>Julodis</i> and <i>Stigmodera</i>); actual specimens
of the insects being placed in position on the maps. The
wall-cases at the end of the gallery are devoted exclusively
to the nests of Ants, Wasps, and Bees. On the east wall is
a large case containing specimens and drawings explaining
the structure of Insects. On the west side, next the Walsingham
collection, are cabinets containing a selection of British Insects.
Lower down are other cabinets in the series of foreign Butterflies;
while foreign Moths and other Insects are arranged in
adjacent cabinets. In another part of the gallery are exhibited
coloured drawings of a few of the smallest Insects known,
namely the <i>Mymaridæ</i>, a group of minute parasitic Hymenoptera;
and above is a drawing of a House-Fly, enlarged in
the same proportion—thirty diameters—to show the contrast. A
few specimens of the insects themselves are placed in the
microscope below.</p>

<p>In the table-cases in the middle of the gallery are specimens
and illustrations of some of the principal families of Insects,
with explanations of the characters by which these may be
recognised. The first case (next to the west door) contains
an introductory series, and then follow the various orders in
sequence commencing with the most primitive forms or Aptera,
among which <i>Campodea</i>, a small British insect, may be
specially noticed.</p>

<p>The classification of Butterflies, Bees and Ants, and Beetles
is shown in the last three cases; and attention may be
specially directed to a series of drawings illustrating the transformations
of Fleas, Gnats, Midges, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
The main collection of insects is kept in cabinets in the
“Insect Room” in the basement, but is open to students under
the regulations mentioned at the end of this guide.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c57">Reptile Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></div>

<p>III. The long Reptile-gallery contains mounted specimens
and skeletons of Reptiles, including Crocodiles, Lizards, Snakes,
and Tortoises, as well as restorations or casts of the remains
of many groups now entirely extinct. The most noticeable
specimen in this gallery is the model of the skeleton of the
gigantic extinct North American land Reptile known as <i>Diplodocus
carnegii</i>, which measures over eighty feet in length, and
was presented by Mr. Andrew Carnegie in 1905. Restored
models of the skeletons of the Iguanodon, a British Dinosaur,
and of the North American Horned Dinosaur (<i>Triceratops</i>) are
also noteworthy.</p>

<p>The Crocodiles and their extinct relatives occupy the cases
on the left of the entrance from the Bird-gallery and also
a stand in the middle of the gallery; and among these
may be specially noticed the Indian Gharial, of which both
the skeleton and skin are exhibited. The two small cases
on each side of the west doorway are occupied by extinct forms
and the peculiar Tuatera Lizard of New Zealand. At the south
end of the east side are arranged the Turtles and Tortoises,
including examples of the Giant Tortoises of the Galapagos (fig.
26) and Mascarene Islands, as well as a large species (<i>Testudo
calcarata</i>) from North Africa. Opposite the Turtles and Tortoises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
are the Snakes, among which two large Pythons, coloured
to nature, form attractive exhibits. Extinct groups occupy
a small case on each side of the east door. Beyond these
come the Lizards, which occupy the cases opposite the Crocodiles.
The series of Old World Monitor Lizards and American
Iguanas is specially noteworthy; and attention may be likewise
directed to the curious worm-like Amphisbænas, of which
the majority inhabit Tropical America. Casts of remains of
the extinct marine Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs are shown in
the small cases on the sides of the doorway in the east wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amphibians (Salamanders and Frogs).</div>

<p>In the Reptile-gallery is placed a large table-case
containing a selection of the more important forms of
Amphibians, which are divided into such as possess a tail:—Salamanders
and Newts; and those without tails:—Frogs and
Toads. During some period of their existence most of these
animals live in the water, when they breathe by gills, and are in
this respect akin to Fishes. The comparatively enormous size
attained by certain tropical species of Frogs and Toads, such as
the South American Horned Frog (<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>), should be noticed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
The largest representative of the group is the Giant Salamander
of Japan and China.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c59">Starfish Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></div>

<p>IV. A small gallery is devoted to Starfishes and their
allies collectively constituting the class <span class="smcap">Echinoderma</span>.
Specimens of these are arranged systematically in table-cases
1–24; and in case 36 are specimens illustrating the
anatomy of the skeleton, and models and figures showing the
remarkable changes undergone by these animals in the course of
their development. In a separate case on the east side of the
gallery is a case containing specimens of a large Starfish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
illustrate the variability in the number of rays from 4 to 7.
In a case on the opposite side is shown <i>Luidia savignei</i> from
Mauritius, one of the largest of Starfishes. The Feather-stars
(<i>Antedon</i>) are also members of this group; but the most beautiful
and remarkable specimens in the gallery are the Sea-Lilies,
or Crinoids, collected by the “Challenger” Expedition. One
specimen was found attached to an old telegraph-wire taken up
in the Caribbean Sea. These deep-sea Crinoids, of which representatives,
now extinct, were abundant in earlier periods of the
world’s history, are exhibited on tables in the corners of the
gallery, by cases 37 and 38. Some of the larval stages of
the Feather-stars (<a href="#fig_28">fig. 28</a>) resemble stalked Crinoids.</p>

<p>The wall-cases contain representatives of the groups collectively
known as Worms. Case 1 contains the Tape-Worms or
Cestoda, and the Flukes or Trematoda, the life-history of a
species of each being illustrated by specimens, figures, and
models. In case 2 the Round-Worms are illustrated by models
of <i>Trichina</i>, and the anatomical structure of various other kinds
is shown by the aid of diagrams. Case 3 contains specimens
of free-living terrestrial and marine Worms, Leeches, and
Gephyreans. Case 4 is devoted to specimens of Echinoderms
preserved in spirit, especially Holothurians, such as Trepangs
or Sea-Cucumbers, the Bêche-de-Mer of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c60">Shell Gallery.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></div>

<p>V. A large gallery is devoted to the great group of Shell-fish
or <span class="smcap">Mollusca</span>, the exhibition of which is, however, mainly
restricted to their shells. In some cases the form of the soft
parts is, however, shown either by specimens in spirit or by
means of models.</p>

<p>In wall-cases on the west side of the gallery is a series of
shells arranged on tablets to show the leading structural types,
such as univalve, bivalve, multivalve, etc.; then the nature
of the outer coat, or “skin”; and, thirdly, some of the more
striking styles of ornamentation and colouring. Following
these, a division is devoted to the display of the general form
of the shells of bivalves, special attention being directed to the
nature of the hinge by which the two valves are joined. Fresh-water
Mussels (<i>Unionidæ</i>) are selected as examples of great
variability in the form of the shell in closely allied species.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Near by is a small series of the shells of boring bivalves, many
in the various substances they perforate. Alongside are shown
in a similar manner modifications in form and structure presented
by Univalve or Gastropod shells; many of the shells having
been cut to show their internal structure. Specimens of the
horny or shelly plate (operculum) closing the mouth of many
Gastropod shells are also exhibited. In one compartment are
displayed spirit-preparations of Cephalopod Molluscs, such as
Octopus, Cuttle-fish, Squids, Nautilus, Argonaut or Paper-Nautilus,
etc. Specimens of the horny beaks possessed by all
members of this class are also exhibited; and a Pearly Nautilus
(<a href="#fig_31">fig. 31</a>), with the shell cut in two in order to show the air-chambers
and the comparatively small space occupied by the
“animal,” will be found of special interest. From the roof are
suspended life-sized models of a Giant Squid (<i>Architenthis</i>) and
a Giant Octopus. The Cephalopods were extraordinarily
numerous in past ages, and many of the fossil forms are
exhibited in the Geological Department.</p>

<i>a</i>, siphon; <i>b</i>, foot; <i>c</i>, tentacles; <i>d</i>, eyes; <i>e</i>, operculum.</div></div>

<p>The main shell-collection is contained in four parallel rows
of table-cases, the arrangement commencing on the right as the
gallery is entered. The first two rows contain the marine forms
of Gastropods—a division which includes Snails, Slugs, Whelks
(<a href="#fig_29">fig. 29</a>), and all those Molluscs which crawl upon the under
surface of their bodies; the Cowries, Cones, Volutes, Mitras, and
Murexes forming some of the most attractive groups. The two
rows of cases on the left contain Land-Shells, Bivalves, and
Cephalopods. The Cockles, Oysters, Clams, Piddocks, Teredos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Scallops, and Ark-Shells represent some of the principal types
of Bivalves, so called on account of their shells being formed of
two pieces or valves. A Giant Clam (<a href="#fig_30">fig. 30</a>), at the S. end
of the gallery, weighs 310 lbs., and measures 36 inches in length.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sea-Mats, Lamp-shells, and Sea-squirts.</div>

<p>In the same gallery are exhibited examples of three other
groups of marine organisms, respectively known as Polyzoa,
Brachiopoda, and Tunicata. The Polyzoa live in colonies, and
include the so-called Sea-Mat. They are often mistaken for
sea-weeds, although in reality they are animals of comparatively
high organisation. The Brachiopods have two shells like
Bivalve Molluscs, but the valves are dorsal and ventral—that
is to say, back and front—instead of right and left. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
valve is frequently perforated, hence the name of “Lamp-shells,”
from a resemblance to an ancient Roman lamp. Sea-squirts,
Tunicates, or Ascidians, are worthy of the attention
of the visitor on account of their affinity with the Vertebrate
stock, of which they may be regarded as a degenerate type. It
is in the larvæ or “Ascidian Tadpoles” that the evidence of
Vertebrate relationship is most conspicuous, as shown by certain
important characters in the nervous system, skeleton, and
respiratory organs.</p>

<p>A series of large shells occupies some of the space in the
wall-cases, among which attention may be directed to the
thick and often handsomely coloured Helmet-shells (<i>Cassis</i>),
which, together with the pink Queen-conch (<i>Strombus</i>), were
formerly largely used in the now nearly obsolete art of cameo-cutting.
In addition to these, a selection of British shells, and
series of the eggs of Molluscs, as well as specimens illustrating
the formation of pearls, and other points of special interest connected
with Molluscs, are displayed. These specimens include
not only the Pearl-oyster, but some of the other shells used in
the mother-of-pearl trade.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap" id="c63">Whale-Room.</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Whale-Room.</div>

<p>Approached by a staircase, leading down from the last (or
western-most) of the passages which connect the Bird-gallery
with the Coral-gallery, is a separate room in which are placed
the specimens of Whales and their relatives. For these, on
account of their large size, no other place could be found in
the Museum; but the room has, unfortunately, the disadvantage
of being too small to display such large animals to full advantage.
It is also intersected by columns, which interfere
with the complete view of the larger specimens.</p>

<p>As it is almost impracticable to preserve the skins of the
larger species of Whales, owing to the oil with which they
are saturated, the exhibition of the characters of these animals is
carried out by means of their skeletons and artificial models of
one side of the body. Complete models, which are much better
than actual skins, of many of the smaller kinds, are shown.
A general account of the structure and classification of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Cetacea, as Whales are technically termed, with reference to
those exhibited in this gallery, will be found in a Special Guide.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh-water Dolphins.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Narwhal.</div>

<p>On the left side of the entrance is a case containing a stuffed
specimen, a skeleton, and several skulls of the Susu, or Fresh-water
Dolphin (<i>Platanista gangetica</i>) of the rivers of India,
and also of the Dolphins of the Rio de la Plata (<i>Pontoporia
blainvillei</i>) and of the River Amazon (<i>Inia geoffroyensis</i>). Among
the specimens fronting the visitor as he enters the room, one of
the most interesting, on account of its remarkable dentition,
is the Narwhal, or Sea-Unicorn. It has only two teeth, which
lie horizontally in the upper jaw. In the female both remain
permanently concealed within the bone of the jaw, so that this
sex is practically toothless; but in the male, while the right
tooth remains similarly concealed and rudimentary (as shown
in the specimen, by removal of part of the bone which covered
it), the left is immensely developed, attaining a length equal to
that of half the entire animal, and projecting horizontally from
the head in the form of a long, straight, tapering and pointed
tusk, spirally grooved on the surface. In rare cases, as in the
skull exhibited near the skeleton, both teeth are fully developed,
and it is noticeable that in such specimens the direction of the
spiral is the same in both tusks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sperm-Whale.</div>

<p>To the right of the entrance is placed a specimen of the
bony framework of one of the most colossal of animals,
the Cachalot, or Sperm-Whale (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), <a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>,
prepared from an old male cast ashore near Thurso, on the
north coast of Scotland, in July, 1863, on the estate of Captain
D. Macdonald, R.E., by whom it was presented to the Museum.
Upon one side of this skeleton has been built the model
of the external form of the animal. The Sperm-Whale is
the principal source of supply of sperm-oil and spermaceti:
the former being obtained by boiling the fat or blubber lying
beneath the skin over the whole body. The latter, in a liquid
state at the ordinary temperature of the living animal, is
contained in cells which fill the immense cavity on the top of
the skull. This Whale, which feeds chiefly on Cephalopods
(Squids and Cuttle-fishes), but also on Fishes, is distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
throughout the warm and temperate
regions of the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, and sometimes
enters British waters.</p>

<p>In order to render this
skeleton more instructive, the
names have been attached to
the principal bones, thus enabling
the visitor to trace at a
glance the extraordinary modification
from the normal mammalian
form the huge skull of
this species has undergone.</p>

Skeleton and outline of animal: <i>b</i>, nostril or blowhole; <i>p</i>, rudimentary pelvic bone.
Length of specimen 54 feet.</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Whalebone Whales.</div>

<p>Most of the largest Cetacea
belong to the group called
“Whalebone Whales,” in which
a series of horny plates termed
“whalebone” grow from the
palate in place of teeth, and
serve to strain the water taken
into the mouth from the small
marine animals on which these
Whales subsist. A representative
of this group is the
skeleton of the Common Rorqual
or Fin-Whale (<i>Balænoptera
musculus</i>) in the south-west
portion of the room. This
Whale, which is sixty-eight feet
long, was captured in 1882 in
the Moray Firth, Scotland.
The flukes of the tail and the
back-fin were preserved with
the skeleton and are placed
above the wall-case behind; the
small pelvic bones, and a rudimentary
nodule representing
the femur or thigh-bone, the
only trace of the hind leg of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
this gigantic animal, are also shown. The external form is
modelled in plaster. In front is a skeleton and half-model of
the Black or North Atlantic Right-Whale (<i>Balæna glacialis</i> or
<i>biscayensis</i>). Below this skeleton is placed a lower jaw of the
Greenland Right-Whale (<i>Balæna mysticetus</i>), the species which
formerly yielded most of the “whalebone” of commerce, and
also a miniature wooden model of the entire animal, on the
scale of one inch to the foot.</p>

<p>Remains of extinct Cetaceans—notably the solid bony beaks
of the skulls of Beaked Whales (<i>Ziphiidæ</i>) from the Red Crag
of the east coast of England—are placed in this gallery.
A special table-case, near the Sperm-Whale, shows the curious
ear-bones of various Cetaceans, both recent and fossil. These
bones are perfectly sufficient for the identification of the kind
of Whale from which they were taken. In a case on the opposite
side of the gallery is displayed the horny wart, termed
by sailors the “bonnet,” found on the nose of the Black Right-Whale.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap" id="c66">First Floor.</span></h3>

<p>The upper floors of the wings of the Museum consist merely
of single galleries extending along the whole front of the
building; for the galleries which run backwards on the ground
floor form only a single storey.</p>

<div class="sidenote" id="c66a">Lower Mammal Gallery.</div>

<p>The Lower Mammal-Gallery is entered from the western
corridor of the central hall. Together with the adjacent
corridor, it contains the greater part of the exhibited series of
recent Mammals, with the exception of the Cetacea, Sirenia, and
Proboscidea, which are downstairs, and the orders Primates,
Chiroptera, Insectivora, and Rodentia, which are in the upper
gallery. As three special guides<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> are devoted to these galleries,
a very brief notice will serve on this occasion. Both stuffed
specimens and skulls and skeletons are exhibited, although the
former constitute by far the greater portion of the series. A few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
remains of extinct types, or plaster reproductions of the same,
are introduced here and there; and photographs of living
animals are hung on the walls, where will also be found some
instructive series showing the modifications assumed by the
teeth of certain groups. Wherever possible, the horns and
antlers of the Ruminants, as well as the horns of the
Rhinoceroses, are placed in juxtaposition to the animals to
which they respectively belong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruminants, etc.</div>

<p>The series commences on the right side of the gallery with
the lowest forms. Down the middle is a row of large Mammals,
comprising various Deer, Seals, and Rhinoceroses. On the right
of the entrance a small case contains the Australian Platypus
or Duck-bill (<a href="#fig_33">fig. 33</a>) and the Echidnas of Australia and New
Guinea, which lay eggs, and are the lowest of all living
Mammals. In the adjacent bay are the Marsupials, such as
Kangaroos, Phalangers, or so-called Opossums, Wombats, and
Bandicoots of Australasia, and the true Opossums of America.
The eighth and ninth bays on the left side contain the so-called
Edentate Mammals, such as the South American Sloths, Ant-eaters,
and Armadillos, the Scaly Ant-eaters or Pangolins (<a href="#fig_34">fig. 34</a>)
of tropical Asia and Africa, and the African Aard-Vark or Ant-Bear.
The Sea-Cows, as represented by the Dugong, the Manatee,
and the recently extinct Rhytina of Bering Island, are shown in
the Geological Department. In the second bay are the Pigs and
Hippopotamuses; in the third the Camels, and near by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Chevrotains, or Mouse-Deer. Following these are the Deer
(<i>Cervidæ</i>), many of which, as already stated, are placed in the
middle line of the gallery. Properly speaking, the Giraffes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
their recent and extinct allies, the former represented by the
Okapi of Central Africa (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>, p. 41), should come here; but,
as already mentioned, it has been found convenient to remove
the Giraffe group into the east corridor of the central hall.
In one of the cases in the bays stands the Prongbuck or
Pronghorn Antelope (<a href="#fig_35">fig. 35</a>), the sole living representative of a
family characterised by the circumstance that the horns have
hollow branched sheaths which are shed annually. Next in
order come the Antelopes, a large number of which are placed in
the corridors outside the gallery. This series, it may be remarked,
is particularly fine, and, in fact, unique. At the last
two bays on the right side of the gallery the visitor reaches the
Goats; and in the “pavilion,” at the west end of the gallery,
he comes to the Sheep, Musk-Oxen, and Oxen, of which there
is a magnificent display, both as regards mounted specimens
and horns. Many of the cases in the middle of the gallery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the bays have been fitted
with artificial groundwork,
one of the most
striking being the European
Reindeer case, for
which the materials were
brought from Norway.</p>

<p>Continuing our survey
down the left side of the
gallery, the bay next the
pavilion and an adjacent
case in the middle line
contain the Zebras, Wild
Asses and the Wild Horse,
among which is a specimen
of the extinct
Quagga. Following this
are the Rhinoceroses and
Tapirs, some of the former
being exhibited in the
middle of the gallery.
Adult specimens of all
the living species except
the one-horned <i>Rhinoceros
sondaicus</i> of Java are
exhibited. The cut (fig.
36) shows the form of
the head and the number
of the horns in
three members of the
group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hyraxes.</div>

<p>In a small case by
themselves are exhibited
the Hyraxes, which represent
a subordinal group
of Ungulates. In this
place should come the
Elephants (Proboscidea),
but it has been found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
advisable to exhibit the existing species of this group alongside
their extinct relatives in the Geological Department, and in
the central hall.</p>

<p>Next in order follow the Seals, Walruses, and Sea-Bears
(<a href="#fig_37">fig. 37</a>); and after these again, the land Carnivora. Among
the former, particular attention may be directed to the specimens
of Sea-Elephants or Elephant-Seals (<a href="#fig_38">fig. 38</a>) of the Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Seas and the Pacific coast of California. The visitor should
also notice the various smaller southern Seals, obtained during
the “Discovery” Expedition, in the case in the bay. Among
the land Carnivora, special interest attaches to the huge
Brown Bear from Alaska, the black and white Bear-like Great
Panda (<a href="#fig_39">fig. 39</a>) of North-eastern China, and the case of Tigers,
in which both the long-haired Manchurian and the short-coated
Indian race are shown.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap" id="c72">Second Floor.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="c72a">Upper Mammal Gallery.</div>

<p>The portion open to the public of the gallery on this floor
in the western wing of the building contains such of the Mammalian
orders (apart from Proboscidea, Cetacea, and Sirenia) as
are not shown in the lower gallery. In the first two wall-cases
on the right on entering the gallery is displayed a series
of Bats, some stuffed, and others in spirit. In the third
wall-case are the Insect-eating Mammals (Insectivora), such as
Shrew-mice, Moles, Hedgehogs, etc. Next come the Rodents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and then the Lemurs, Monkeys, and Apes, the greater number
of the last being exhibited in the large case in the middle of
the gallery. Among the more striking specimens may be
mentioned the series of Gorillas (<a href="#fig_40">fig. 40</a>) and Chimpanzees,
and the Proboscis and Snub-nosed Monkeys.</p>

<p>Nearly all the left side of this gallery is devoted to
Anthropology, that is to say, to the representation of the
zoological characters of the different races of Mankind<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>; the
series including busts, skeletons, skulls, hair, and portraits.</p>

<p>At the west end of the portion of this gallery open to
the public stands a case exhibiting many of the structural
differences distinguishing the man-like Apes from Man himself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and also showing different types of human skulls and the
method of measuring the same. On the adjacent screens and
partitions are diagrams, photographs, and sketches illustrating
hand and finger prints, and identification by means of the latter.</p>

<h3 id="c74">EAST WING.</h3>

<h3 id="c74a"><span class="smcap">Ground Floor.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="c74b">Fossil Collection.</div>

<p>The ground floor of this wing consists, as on the other side of
the building, of a gallery running west and east the whole length
of the wing in front, of a smaller parallel gallery behind this,
and leading from the latter a series of galleries running north
and south. With the exception of a certain number of recent
skeletons introduced for comparison, and some of the specimens
of Elephants and Sirenians or Sea-Cows, the whole
of this floor is occupied by the collection of the remains of
animals and plants which flourished in geological periods
previous to the one in which we are now living. Some of these
belong to species still existing upon the earth, but the great
majority are extinct. They are arranged mainly upon zoological
principles, that is, the groups which are believed to have natural
affinities are placed together; but within some of the great
divisions thus mapped out, especially of the Invertebrata and
Plants, it has been found convenient to adopt a stratigraphical
or even geographical grouping, the fossils of different geological
formations being kept apart, and those of the British Isles
separated from those of foreign localities.</p>

<p>This portion of the Museum is more fully described in the
special Guides<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> than is possible in the present work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elephants, Sea-Cows, and Extinct Mammals.</div>

<p>The front gallery, entered from the central hall, is devoted
to Elephants and Sea-Cows, both living and extinct, and to
extinct and fossil Mammals of other groups. Down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
middle are placed a number of large and striking objects, of
too great size to be contained in the wall-cases. The first is a
nearly complete skeleton of the American Mastodon (<a href="#fig_41">fig. 41</a>), an
animal closely allied to modern Elephants, from which it is
chiefly distinguished by the characters of its cheek-teeth. This
is followed by a skeleton of the existing Indian Elephant
(<i>Elephas maximus</i>), and the mounted skin of a tuskless male
of the same species, brought home from India by His Majesty
King Edward VII., when Prince of Wales. Further down the
gallery is the skull of the extinct <i>E. ganesa</i>—remarkable for
the immense length of its tusks—from the Siwalik Hills of
India; and another of the Mammoth (<i>E. primigenius</i>), with
huge curved tusks, in a perfect state of preservation, found in
the Brick-earth at Ilford, Essex.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Then follow skeletons of the
great extinct Irish Deer (<i>Cervus giganteus</i>), male and female,
the former distinguished by its magnificent spreading antlers,
resembling those of a Fallow Deer on a large scale.</p>

The next central case is occupied by the skulls and portions
of jaws of a remarkable horned hoofed quadruped, <i>Arsinoïtherium</i>
(<a href="#fig_42">fig. 42</a>), from the Upper Eocene of the Fayum, Egypt.
It belongs to an ancient group not closely related to any
living animal.</p>

<p>Near by is placed a model of a skeleton of the <i>Dinoceras</i>
(<a href="#fig_44">fig. 44</a>), one of the most remarkable of the many wonderful
forms of animal life discovered in the Tertiary beds of the
western portion of the United States of America. This animal
combines in some respects the characters of a Rhinoceros with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
those of an Elephant, and has others altogether special to itself.
The group to which it belonged became extinct in the Oligocene,
or Middle Tertiary, period, without leaving any successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sea-Cows.</div>

<p>Near the pavilion is a skeleton (<a href="#fig_45">fig. 45</a>) of an interesting
animal, the Northern Sea-Cow (<i>Rhytina gigas</i> or <i>stelleri</i>), the
last resort of which was Bering Island in the North Pacific,
where it was completely exterminated towards the close of the
eighteenth century. In the same case is placed the skeleton of
a smaller allied animal, the <i>Halitherium</i>, from the Oligocene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
South Germany. These, with their existing representatives,
the Manatee and Dugong, constitute the order Sirenia, aquatic
Mammals of fish-like form, presenting
considerable external resemblance
to Cetacea (Whales and
Dolphins), but differing in many
points of structure and habit. All
the exhibited specimens of the
group, both living and extinct, are
shown in this gallery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fossil remains of Man.</div>

<p>The wall-cases on the south side
(right on entering) contain typical
series of chipped and polished flint
implements of human workmanship,
and also remains of Man
found, under circumstances which
may justify the appellation of
“fossil,” in caves or Pleistocene
deposits, associated with the bones
of Mammals either completely or
locally extinct. Then follow in
systematic order the bones and
teeth of the other Primates, the
Carnivora, Ungulata, and Sirenia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elephants and Ruminants.</div>

<p>The greater part of the north
side of the gallery is devoted to the
exhibition of the remains of Proboscidea
(Dinotheres, Mastodons,
and Elephants), as well as teeth
and skulls of the two existing
species of Elephants. The forerunners
of the Proboscidea from
the Eocene strata of Egypt, as
represented by <i>Palæomastodon</i> and
<i>Mœritherium</i>, are of special interest.
Attention may likewise be directed
to the skull of the gigantic Ruminant
<i>Sivatherium</i> (<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>), from
the Siwalik deposits of Northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
India, an ally of the living African Okapi (p. 41), with which it
is connected by <i>Helladotherium</i> of the Grecian Tertiary deposits;
another still more nearly allied type being <i>Samotherium</i>, from
the Isle of Samos, of which a skull (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47</a>) is exhibited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edentates.</div>

<p>In the “pavilion,” or large room at the end of the gallery,
are skeletons and bones of the members of the order Edentata,
mostly from South America, including fine specimens of the
great Ground-Sloths, the largest of which, the <i>Megatherium</i>, is
shown in the act of rearing itself on its hind-legs and powerful
tail to seize and tear down the branches of a tree in order to
feed upon the leaves. That this was the habit of this huge
animal is clearly indicated by the structure of its bones and
teeth. The mounted specimen is not an actual skeleton, but is
composed of plaster-casts of the real bones, most of which are
shown in the wall-case at the north side of the room. Of the
<i>Mylodon</i>, a smaller but nearly allied animal, an almost perfect
skeleton is exhibited in a glass case near the <i>Megatherium</i>.
Near by is a portion of the skin of a closely similar animal
(<i>Grypotherium listai</i>), from a cave in Patagonia, showing the
hair, and also the nodules of bone embedded in the hide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marsupials.</div>

<p>Not far off is shown one of the glyptodons, huge extinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Armadillo-like animals, of which the body is enclosed in a
solid barrel-like bony case. As these animals far surpassed in
size their diminutive existing representatives, so the gigantic
Marsupials of the corresponding period in Australia (Pleistocene,
or latest Tertiary), such as <i>Diprotodon</i> and <i>Nototherium</i>, greatly
exceeded any of the species now existing on that continent;
of <i>Diprotodon</i> a complete skeleton is exhibited. On the other
hand, all the Mammals of the earlier geological periods of
which remains are known are of diminutive size, as seen in
the series of jaws, teeth, etc., mostly from the Purbeck (Upper
Oolite) beds of Dorset and the Stonesfield Slate (Great Oolite)
of Oxfordshire, exhibited in the centre window-case on the
east side of the room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extinct Birds.</div>

<p>The south side of this room (right on entering) is chiefly
reserved for the remains of extinct Birds, including the famous
Lizard-tailed Bird (<i>Archæopteryx</i>) of the Solenhofen beds of
Bavaria (<a href="#fig_48">fig. 48</a>), the oldest known member of the class.
Although presenting many Reptile-like characters, it had well-developed
feathers on the wings and tail, the impressions of
which are beautifully preserved in the specimen. A series of
skeletons of the “Moas,” or <i>Dinornithidæ</i>, of New Zealand,
birds in which no trace of a wing has been discovered, shows
the diversity in size of different members of the group, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
far exceeding any existing Ostrich, while others are scarcely
larger than a good-sized Turkey. Some of these remains are
so recent as still to be covered with dried skin, and even feathers.
Several eggs are also shown; but, large as these are, they are
greatly exceeded in size by those of the Roc (<i>Æpyornis</i>) from
Madagascar. The skull and certain other remains of a gigantic
extinct bird, <i>Phororhachos</i>, from Patagonia are also shown in
this room. These birds appear to have been allied to the
existing South American Seriema.</p>

<p>The long corridor north of the fossil Mammal-gallery contains
a fine assemblage of Reptilian remains. The south side
is devoted to the Great Sea-Lizards (Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia),
mostly from the Lias formation. The skeleton of an
Ichthyosaur from the Lias is shown in <a href="#fig_50">fig. 50</a>. Skeletons of
Plesiosaurians and Pliosaurians from the Oxford Clay are
mounted in central cases. Ranged in the cases on the north
side are remains of the gigantic Dinosaurs, which vastly
exceeded in size any other land-animals. A mounted plaster
cast of a complete skeleton of the Iguanodon (<a href="#fig_49">fig. 49</a>), found
(with many others) in the Wealden strata at Bernissart in
Belgium, is exhibited in the gallery of recent Reptiles; but
a large series of bones of the same reptile is shown here.</p>

In the centre of this gallery is placed a large portion of the
skeleton of a gigantic Dinosaur
(<i>Cetiosaurus leedsi</i>) from the
Upper Jurassic Oxford Clay
near Peterborough. It is nearly
allied to the North American
<i>Diplodocus</i>, of which, as mentioned
on page 57, the model
of a complete skeleton is exhibited
in the recent Reptile
Gallery. Both <i>Cetiosaurus</i> and
<i>Diplodocus</i> resemble <i>Brontosaurus</i>
(<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>) in the extremely
small size of the skull.
Another central case contains
an actual skull and other remains
of the American Cretaceous
horned Dinosaur <i>Triceratops</i>
(see <a href="#c57">page 57</a>), and in
wall-case 8 is placed a plaster
cast of the skull of the
contemporary <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>,
the largest known carnivorous
Dinosaur.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the
gallery are the Pterosauria
or Ornithosauria, commonly
called Pterodactyles or Flying
Reptiles. Their most gigantic
representatives were the species
of <i>Pteranodon</i> from the Upper
Cretaceous of Kansas (<a href="#fig_53">fig. 53</a>).
At the west end is the nearly
complete skeleton of <i>Pariasaurus</i>
(<a href="#fig_52">fig. 52</a>) from the Karoo formation (Trias) of South Africa.
It occurs also in Russia, and belongs to a primitive section of
the Theromorphs, or Anomodonts, which include the ancestors
of Mammals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extinct Fishes.</div>

<p>Of the galleries running northwards from the Fossil Reptile
gallery, the one nearest to the central hall is used for
the display of the Fossil Fishes, many belonging to groups
now extinct. Perhaps the most remarkable of all, and
certainly most unlike existing forms, are the armoured
Devonian Fishes known as <i>Cephalaspis</i>, <i>Pterichthys</i> (<a href="#fig_54">fig. 54</a>),
etc. The well-preserved fishes from the Chalk are especially
noteworthy, and a specimen of <i>Portheus</i> in a central case,
14 feet in length, is one of the largest bony fishes known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extinct Invertebrates and Plants.</div>

<p>The next gallery contains the Cephalopods, a group of Molluscs
abounding in extinct species, of which the Belemnites, Turrilites
(<a href="#fig_55">fig. 55</a>), and Ammonites (<a href="#fig_56">fig. 56</a>) are some of the best-known.
The form and structure of their nearest living representatives,
the various species of Cuttle-fishes, Squids, Argonauts, and
Nautilus (<a href="#fig_31">fig. 31</a>, page 62) are illustrated by models, drawings,
and specimens placed near the entrance of the gallery and along
the top-line of the wall-cases. The third gallery contains the
remaining Mollusca, with the Brachiopoda, Polyzoa, Echinoderma,
Worms, and Crustacea; the fourth, the Corals, Sponges,
Protozoa, and Fossil Plants. In these last two galleries most
of the British specimens are placed in the table-cases, and those
of foreign origin in the cases round the walls.</p>

<p>Among numerous other groups which cannot be mentioned,
great interest attaches to the Trilobites (<a href="#fig_57">fig. 57</a>) of the Palæozoic
epoch, which are related to the modern King-Crabs and also
have affinity with the Scorpions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Very extensive is the collection of Fossil Plants from the
Coal-Measures, among which <i>Lepidodendron</i> and <i>Sigillaria</i>,
as well as numerous kinds of fern-like leaves, are among the
most common.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical Collections.</div>

<p>The table-cases of the end gallery contain certain special
collections of historical interest, either from the circumstances
under which they were formed, or the manner in which they
came into possession of the Museum, or from their containing
a large number of type specimens described and figured in
various publications. Hence it has been considered undesirable
to break up and disperse these among the general collection.
They include the original collection formed by William Smith,
the pioneer of geology in this country, the Searles Wood
collection of Crag Mollusca, the Edwards collection of Eocene
Mollusca, the Davidson collection of Brachiopoda, the types of
Sowerby’s “Mineral Conchology,” and lastly, but not least in
interest, specimens from the collection of Sir Hans Sloane,
which formed part of the nucleus of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British Stratigraphical Collection.</div>

<p>In the wall-cases on the west side of this gallery is exhibited
a stratigraphical collection, showing a series of rock-specimens,
often with their included fossil remains, representing the
various geological formations of the British Isles; they are
arranged in the order of their sequence in time, commencing near
the entrance door with the most recent, and gradually passing
down to the most ancient fossil-bearing strata. Along the top
of the case is displayed a running section of all the water-formed
rocks of England in the order of their succession, each bed
being distinctively coloured, and named to correspond with the
actual specimens placed beneath. The stratigraphical collection
is followed by some illustrations of rock-formation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
certain curious rock-structures simulating fossils. On the east
side are exhibited additional specimens of marine Reptiles from
the Lias and a series of footprints of Reptiles from the Trias
of N. America, the New Red Sandstone of England, etc.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap" id="c90">First Floor.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="c90a">Gallery of Minerals.</div>

<p>The gallery on this floor, entered from the south end of
the east corridor of the hall, contains the extensive Mineral
collections, a fuller description of which will be found in
special guides.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory Collections.</div>

<p>Entering the gallery the visitor will find, in the first window-case
on the left-hand side, a series of specimens selected and
labelled to serve as an introduction to the study of Minerals.
Beginning with a definition of what is meant by a Mineral, it
shows how essential characters were gradually recognised,
and how Minerals are distributed into kinds and classified.
In the next three window-cases specimens are arranged to
illustrate the characters of Minerals and the various terms
used in their description.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rocks.</div>

<p>In the remaining six window-cases on the same side of the
gallery, a corresponding series of specimens illustrative of the
characters and classification of Rocks is exhibited; and the
eleven window-cases on the opposite side contain a collection
illustrating the various kinds of Rocks.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">General Collection of Minerals.</div>

<p>In the table-cases of the gallery are exhibited specimens of
every important Mineral species and variety preserved in the
Museum. The cases containing this general collection are
numbered from 1 to 41, and the eight panes of each case are
severally distinguished by the letters <i>a</i> to <i>h</i>. For the use of
the student there is published an Index to the names of all
the numerous Mineral species and varieties represented in the
collection, with references to the table-cases in which the
specimens are placed.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
The system of classification, which includes not only ores,
but all known Minerals, is not easy for the visitor to follow, and
it is therefore convenient to indicate the positions in the gallery
of those minerals—as, for instance, precious and ornamental
stones, and metallic ores—which have an interest for all; for
details, reference must be made to the Mineral Guide. Most
of these Minerals occur as crystals, the forms of which can
be referred to six systems of crystallisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Native Elements.</div>

<p>I. In cases 1 and 2 are the native metals, as Copper, Silver,
Gold, and Platinum; and non-metals, as Sulphur, Diamond,
and Graphite. The large symmetrical South African “Colenso”
Diamond (<a href="#fig_58">fig. 58</a>), weighing 130 carats, presented by the late
Professor John Ruskin, is worthy of special attention (case 1f).
Models of some famous diamonds, including “The Cullinan
Diamond,” the largest ever found (weight before being cut,
3025¾ carats, or about 1⅓ lb. av.) are exhibited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sulphides.</div>

<p>II. The next six cases contain Minerals which have mostly a
metallic lustre and consist of metals in chemical combination
with elements of the Sulphur or Arsenic groups.</p>

<p>Argentite (3d) is an important Silver-ore, containing 87 per
cent. of Silver and 13 of Sulphur.</p>

<p>Blende (4b) is a valuable Zinc-ore, and contains 67 per cent.
of Zinc and 33 per cent. of Sulphur.</p>

<p>Galena (4e) is by far the most important ore of Lead (Lead
87, Sulphur 13, per cent.).</p>

<p>Copper-glance (3e) is a common ore of Copper (Copper 80,
Sulphur 20, per cent.).</p>

<p>Cinnabar (3h) is the ore from which Mercury or Quicksilver
is obtained (Mercury 86, Sulphur 14, per cent.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Pyrites (5d), one of the most common of Minerals, is a
compound of Iron and Sulphur (Iron 47, Sulphur 53,
per cent.).</p>

<p>Erubescite (5e), Copper pyrites (5f), and Tetrahedrite, or Grey
Copper-ore (7a), are valuable sources of Copper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chlorides, etc.</div>

<p>III. Common Salt, the chloride of the metal Sodium, is exhibited
in case 8f, and Fluor-spar, a fluoride of Calcium
belonging to the same division, begins at case 7e.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxides.</div>

<p>IV. The next division consists of compounds of Oxygen and
includes most of the stony Minerals.</p>

<p>Cuprite (10a), an important ore of Copper (Copper 89,
Oxygen 11, per cent.), is at first ruby-red in colour, but becomes
blackened by exposure to light.</p>

<p>Spinel (10e), in its transparent varieties, is one of the precious
stones; the deep red being the Spinel Ruby (less dense and
less hard than the true Ruby), the rose-tinted the Balas Ruby,
and the yellow or orange-red the Rubicelle of the jewellers:
sometimes, it has a dark blue colour. On account of their
hardness, the less valuable specimens are used for the jewelling
of watches.</p>

<p>Magnetite, or Magnetic Iron-ore (10f), the richest ore of Iron,
of which it contains 72 per cent., is the natural magnet.</p>

<p>Uraninite, or Pitchblende (10h), consists mainly of Uranium
and Oxygen, but contains traces of Helium and Radium, of
which latter it is the commercial source.</p>

<p>Chrysoberyl (9e) is another precious stone, almost equal in
lustre and hardness to the Sapphire; one variety is a beautiful
greenish-yellow; another, with a peculiar play of light, is the
Cat’s-eye; and a third, green by sunlight, but red by candle- or
lamp-light, is known as Alexandrite.</p>

<p>Corundum (9f), when clear and of the proper colour, is, after
the Diamond, the most precious of stones. When pure, it is colourless,
but with minute traces of colouring ingredient it assumes
the richest and most varied hues; when red it is Ruby,
and when blue Sapphire; the yellow, green, and purple
varieties were at one time known respectively as the Oriental
Topaz, Emerald, and Amethyst. The prefix “Oriental” was
at first used to suggest that the stones are not ordinary
Topaz, Emerald, and Amethyst, but other similarly coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
minerals coming from the East (India, Ceylon, Siam, Pegu,
etc.); it was afterwards understood to suggest only the excellence
of their characters. The Star-stone, another variety
of Corundum, when placed in a strong light shows a six-rayed
star.</p>

<p>Hæmatite (11a) is a valuable ore of iron (Iron 70,
Oxygen 30, per cent.).</p>

<p>Cassiterite, or Tin-stone (11f), is the ore of Tin, of which
metal it contains 79 per cent.</p>

<p>Zircon (13b), when clear and without flaws, is one of the
precious stones: one variety with peculiar red tints is the
Hyacinth or Jacynth, while the colourless, yellowish, and dull
green phases are termed Jargoon: the colourless variety, owing
to its high refractive and dispersive power, approaches the
Diamond in brilliancy.</p>

<p>Quartz, which is Silica, the oxide of Silicon, is the most
common of Minerals. In its clear and transparent variety
it is the Crystal of the ancients and the Rock-Crystal of
modern times; it is the Brazilian Pebble of spectacle-makers
(14c). After the clear come the smoky varieties, including
the Scotch Cairngorm and Occidental Topaz (14g). Next
follows the Amethyst (14g), one of the less valuable, though
one of the most beautiful, of gem stones. The Quartz Cat’s-eye
(13f) is a variety presenting a similar play of light to that
of the Chrysoberyl Cat’s-eye already referred to: the effect
is due to enclosed fibres of an Asbestos-like mineral in the
specimens from Ceylon, and to fibres of Crocidolite in the blue,
and of altered Crocidolite in the brownish-yellow specimens
from South Africa.</p>

<p>Jasper (13g) is a coloured mixture of Silica and Clay, distinguished
from ordinary Quartz by its opacity and dull earthy
fracture. It is of various colours, chiefly red, brown, yellow,
and green; the colours being arranged sometimes in a nodular
form, as in Egyptian Jasper, at other times in stripes, as in
Riband Jasper.</p>

<p>The Lydian or Touch-stone (15a), by reason of its hardness
and black colour, has been used from remote ages to test the
purity of precious metals.</p>

<p>Hornstone (15a) is a variety of Silica without evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
crystallisation, and generally presenting a more or less splintery
fracture; in one kind, Flint (15b), the surface of fracture is
generally shell-shaped (conchoidal), sometimes conical, as is
well shown by specimens in the case.</p>

<p>Chalcedony (15b), which has a lustre nearly that of wax,
is translucent. The specimens of Enhydros from Uruguay
(15d) are of especial interest as containing imprisoned water.</p>

<p>Heliotrope, or Bloodstone (16a), is a green stone with red,
blood-like spots.</p>

<p>Next follow the Plasma and Chrysoprase, which are green
stones: and the Sard, generally brownish-red; as also the
Sardonyx, its banded variety. All were much prized by the
ancients because, though hard and tough enough to resist
ordinary wear and tear, they are more suited to the display of
the engraver’s skill than the still harder and more precious
stones.</p>

<p>Then come the Agates (16b), chiefly formed of thin layers of
porous Chalcedony of different colours, though the material of
many of the white layers is a compact Semi-opal. Most are
now brought from Uruguay, in South America, and cut and
polished at Oberstein, in Germany, where in former times
Agates were collected in quantity from the mountains of the
district. Sometimes the layers are parallel, and the stone is
then an Onyx, useful as a material for cameos: or the bands of
a section are arranged in parallel sets of zigzag lines, and the
stone is then called a Fortification-agate; but in the ordinary
agate the layers are variously curved. Moss-agates, or Mocha-stones
(16e), are varieties of Chalcedony enclosing moss-like
forms of oxides of Manganese and Iron, and green earthy
Chlorite. Carnelian (16e) is a beautiful red stone much valued
by the engraver: its fracture has a peculiar waxy lustre,
and is distinct from that of the Sard, which is dull and
horn-like.</p>

<p>Opal, including the Precious or Noble Opal (16f), among the
specimens of which is a fine suite from Queensland presented
by the late Professor Story-Maskelyne, is hydrated Silica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carbonates.</div>

<p>Witherite, the carbonate of Barium (18a), is used in the
manufacture of plate-glass. Strontianite (18b), the carbonate
of Strontium, is one of two minerals from which Strontium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
nitrate is made for use in the manufacture of fireworks, owing
to the fine crimson colour which the salt gives to the flame:
the Strontium minerals are also employed in connection with
sugar-refining. Cerussite (18b) is the corresponding carbonate
of Lead, and when abundant is a valuable ore of that
metal.</p>

<p>Calcite (18e), a carbonate of the metal Calcium, is represented
by a fine suite of specimens, illustrating an almost endless
variety of crystalline form. The clear variety from Iceland is
largely used in optical instruments for polarising light.
Chalybite, or Spathic Iron-ore (20h), is the carbonate of
Iron, and a valuable ore of that metal. The most important
English Iron-ore, Clay Ironstone, is a mixture of Chalybite and
Clay. Calamine (19h), a carbonate of Zinc, is an important Zinc-ore.
Chessylite (21d) and Malachite (22b) are respectively the
blue and green carbonates of Copper, and are used as ores of
that metal. Malachite is found in large masses; by reason of
the high polish which it takes and its beautiful markings, it is
much used for ornamental work of various kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silicates.</div>

<p>Passing to the Silicates, we come to Olivine (22f), one of the
less hard of the precious stones; when of a yellow colour it
is known as Chrysolite, while the green variety is the Peridot
of jewellers. Hiddenite (23a) is a rare emerald-green variety
of Spodumene, and Kunzite is a lilac-coloured variety which
is used as a gem stone.</p>

<p>Asbestos (24c), a kind of Hornblende (a mineral common in
rocks of igneous origin), is found in long fibres; in some of its
varieties it is so flexible that it can be woven into gloves and
other articles. The term Asbestos, meaning unquenched or
unquenchable, was applied by the ancient Greeks, because, owing
to being unaltered by heat, wicks made of this mineral were
used in maintaining the perpetual sacred fires of their temples.
Napkins of Asbestos were cleaned by being thrown into the
fire; Asbestos-cloth was also used in the process of cremation
to keep the ashes of the body distinct from those of the fuel. It
is now employed for lining iron-safes, packing for steam-pipes
and boilers, and in gas-stoves, for which purposes its low conductivity
for heat renders it serviceable.</p>

<p>Jade or Nephrite (24d), a valued mineral, belongs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
same group as Hornblende. The various shades of colour and
the beautiful polish which this tough mineral will take are
illustrated by specimens in the case. Several worked specimens
from New Zealand and China are exhibited. An
immense water-worn mass, weighing 1156 lb., found some
years ago in Asiatic Russia, is mounted on a separate stand
near by.</p>

<p>Meerschaum (23g), the light soft porous mineral used for
tobacco-pipes, is a hydrated silicate of Magnesium. Serpentine
(25a) is another hydrated Magnesium-silicate: the
ease with which it is worked and polished, its green colour, and
varied markings render it much sought after as a material
for mantel-pieces, tables, and other indoor work: exposed to
the weather it soon loses its polish.</p>

<p>Topaz (25c) in its clear varieties is one of the precious
stones. The crystals from the Urulga river, Siberia, are
remarkably fine, and of a delicate brown colour; they are
kept covered, as the action of light slowly bleaches them.
The yellow crystals from Brazil assume a peculiar pink colour
when heated, and are then known to jewellers as Burnt
or Pink Topaz. A fine orange-red crystal from Brazil is
exhibited.</p>

<p>Garnet also belongs to the group of precious stones; when
the red is tinged with violet, the stone is the Almandine or
Syrian Garnet (named after Syriam in Pegu), and when cut <i>en
cabochon</i>, the Carbuncle of jewellery (26f); the Cinnamon-stone
or Hessonite varies in tint from hyacinth-red to honey-yellow
(26e); the Pyrope, including the “Cape Ruby” and the
Bohemian garnet, is blood-red (26e), Demantoid is an emerald-green
(26g).</p>

<p>Jadeite (27a) is one of the green stones which, under the
name of Jade, are wrought into ornaments in China: from
jade it is distinguished by its chemical composition, structure,
and higher specific gravity. Among the specimens of Epidote
(27c) a remarkable series from the Untersulzbachthal, Austria,
is exhibited.</p>

<p>Mica (28a) is the name given to a group of minerals differing
much from each other in chemical composition and optical properties,
but having as a common character an easy splitting, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
cleavage, in a single direction, and thus affording plates remarkably
thin, transparent, tough, and elastic. One of these
minerals, Muscovite (28d), has been used in Russia in place
of glass for windows, and is now in common use for lanterns
and stoves, not being so easily cracked as glass by changes of
temperature; it is often known in commerce as talc, a term
restricted by mineralogists to a different mineral.</p>

<p>The group of Felspars, the most important of the rock-forming
minerals, begins at case 28f. After the Felspars comes Beryl,
of which the bright green variety, Emerald (29c), is one of the
most valued of precious stones. It was in ancient times
worked in Egypt, as is proved by specimens found in the
old workings by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, and presented by
him to the Museum. Emeralds occur in the Urals; but the
locality for the finest stones has long been Muzo, about
seventy miles from Santa Fé de Bogotá, in South America.
Faceted specimens of the colourless Beryl, of the bluish-green
Beryl, known in jewellery as Aquamarine, and of pink Beryl
from California and Madagascar, are exhibited (30a).</p>

<p>In cases 30f to 32d will be found examples of the Zeolite
group of minerals.</p>

<p>Tourmaline (33a), when free from flaws, is, in some of its
varieties, to be classed with the precious stones; among these
being a pink variety called Rubellite. Fine specimens of
Rubellite from Burma, the Urals, and Madagascar, are shown in
the case; one specimen from Burma, poor in colour but remarkable
for its size and shape, was brought home by Colonel
Symes, to whom it had been presented by the King of Ava in
the year 1795. The pink-and-green tourmalines from Maine,
U.S.A., and the magnificent crystals from San Diego Co.,
California, are among the more beautiful of the mineral products
of the United States. Examples of the blue Tourmaline,
or Indicolite, are shown in case 33b.</p>

<p>A rich blue mineral, the Lapis-lazuli of jewellery (34b),
brought from Persia, Siberia, Bokhara, and Chili, is a mixture
of various species. When powdered, Lapis-lazuli furnished the
once costly pigment ultramarine; but by the discovery of a
method of producing an artificial and cheap form of the latter,
the use of the mineral as a pigment has ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sulphates, Phosphates, etc.</div>

<p>The sulphates of Strontium, Celestite (35c), of Barium, Barytes
or Heavy Spar (36a), and of Lead, Anglesite (36e), are all represented
by series of specimens.</p>

<p>Gypsum, or Selenite (36f), is a hydrated sulphate of the metal
Calcium: when heated, it gives up its water of crystallisation and
falls to a white powder, known as “Plaster of Paris,” which,
when moistened, again combines with water and yields a coherent
solid. Gypseous Alabaster, a massive variety of Gypsum (36h),
owing to its whiteness, fine texture, and softness is used as a
material for statuettes and other indoor ornaments. Oriental
Alabaster is a harder substance, Stalagmitic Calcite, carbonate
of Calcium.</p>

<p>Borax (37c), a borate of Sodium, is much used as a flux, also
in soldering, and in the preparation of easily fusible enamels.
It was formerly carried over the Himalayas on sheep and goats
from lakes in Tibet, but is now obtained largely from the Borax-lakes
of the United States, and is also extensively prepared
from the boracic acid lagoons in Tuscany.</p>

<p>Nitratine or Soda-nitre (37d), found in Chili in beds of large
extent, is largely used for the preparation of Nitric Acid and
Saltpetre, and is also used as a fertiliser.</p>

<p>Calaite or Turquoise (38g), a phosphate of the metals Aluminium
and Copper, is generally massive; only very rarely
does it occur in the crystalline state. Being as hard as
Felspar and taking a good polish, it has been much prized
in jewellery; that which comes into the market is chiefly
brought from the Turquoise-mines not far from Nishapur,
in Persia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amber.</div>

<p>As a supplement to the collection of simple Minerals, is
arranged, in case 41, a group of natural substances which
either belong or are closely related to the Mineral Kingdom,
although, in the formation of most, organised matter has played
a very important part. The most important of these are Coal
and Amber. Coal (41a), in most of its varieties, gives structural
evidence of its vegetable origin: its chemical composition
depends on the amount of change which has taken place,
and thus is less definite than in the preceding minerals.
In the variety called Anthracite all traces of the original
organised structure have disappeared. Amber (41c), in ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
times regarded as one of the precious stones, is likewise
of vegetable origin. It is fossil resin, chiefly derived from trees
allied to the pines; its originally sticky condition is proved by
the insects sometimes found enclosed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Larger Mineral Specimens.</div>

<p>In the pavilion at the east end of the gallery the visitor will
find many mineral specimens which, owing to their size, cannot
be satisfactorily exhibited in the table-cases.</p>

<p>Among these, attention may be directed to the magnificent
series of Minerals in the wall-cases, and to the large specimen
of Gypsum, or Selenite, presented by H.R.H. the late Prince
Consort, which, with some fine masses of Iceland Spar, is exhibited
in a special case.</p>

<p>Of the four table-cases in the windows of the pavilion, the
first three contain a series illustrating the various kinds of
Pseudomorphs, or minerals in which the original constituent
has been altered and replaced by a new substance which
preserves the crystalline form of the first. The fourth displays
a set of specimens selected by the late Professor Ruskin to
illustrate varieties of Silica.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Meteorites.</div>

<p>The most important feature of the pavilion is the collection
of Meteorites,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> of which the smaller specimens are shown in the
four central cases. The fall of masses of stone and iron from
the sky, though observed again and again since the most remote
ages, was very rarely credited by anyone beside the spectators
themselves; and till the beginning of the nineteenth century no
attempt was made to collect such specimens for examination
and comparison. In the special guide it is shown how
evidence of the actual fall of such bodies at length became
irresistible, and a description is given of the circumstances
attending their fall, of their general characters, and their
chemical composition: illustrative specimens, collected together
for easy reference, will be found in one of the cases. It is also
shown that meteorites are closely related, not only to shooting
stars, but also to comets, and probably to nebulæ and fixed
stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap" id="c100">Second Floor.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote" id="c100a">Botanical Gallery.</div>

<p>The upper floor of the East wing is devoted to the Department
of Botany.</p>

<p>The Collections of this Department consist of two portions,
the one open to the public and consisting of specimens suitable
for exhibition, and mainly intended to illustrate the various
groups of the Vegetable Kingdom and the broad facts on
which the natural system of the classification of plants is
based; the other set apart for the use of persons engaged in the
detailed scientific study of plants.</p>

<p>On the landing outside the gallery is a series of tree-sections
representing some common British-grown trees, with sections
and bark of the Cork-Oak (<i>Quercus suber</i>), and large sections of
the White Fir and Douglas Pine from British Columbia. The
Douglas Pine was cut down in 1885 when 533 years old;
its age is indicated by the annual rings seen in transverse
section of the wood, and a record of events has been painted
on the surface. A collection of plant-abnormalities is also
shown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">System of Classification.</div>

<p>The system of classification followed in the exhibition-cases
in the public gallery is a modification of one widely used on
the Continent and in America. In the first bay on the left-hand
side an attempt has been made to illustrate, by means of
books dealing with the subject, the history and development of
modern systems of classification. There is a <i>Guide</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> to this
exhibition. The series of specimens (starting on the north, or
left-hand, side of the gallery) begins with the simpler orders of
Dicotyledonous Seed-plants, those in which petals are wanting
in the flower or if present are free from each other, and passes
on to the less simple orders with united petals. The orders are
represented by dried or otherwise prepared specimens of the
plants themselves, drawings, fruits, and prepared sections of the
woods. Diagrams are employed to indicate the characters in
the flowers on which the grouping is based. The use of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
same colour for corresponding structures throughout the
diagrams readily conveys to the eye the points of agreement
or difference on which the classification rests. The geological
history of each natural order is indicated on a table of strata,
and its present distribution on the surface of the earth given on
a small map of the world. Descriptive labels afford particular
information respecting each specimen.</p>

<p>The Dicotyledonous Plants extend to the fifth case on the
left side of the gallery, and are followed by the Monocotyledonous
orders, which fill a portion of the last case on the same
side, the two half-cases at the end of the gallery, and the first
case returning towards the door. The Gymnosperms are placed
in the next case. Then follow the Cryptogams, a case being
devoted to the higher, vascular orders, and another to the
cellular plants. The series closes with an interesting collection
of models of the larger British Fungi, coloured and mounted
in accordance with their natural habitats. A Catalogue of
these models has been prepared.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> In the table-case in the
last bay is placed an illustrated collection of the British Mycetozoa,
to which there is also a <i>Guide</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> A large chalk-like mass
of Diatom-earth containing twelve billion Diatoms is placed in
a case by itself near the entrance to the gallery. The table-
and window-cases in the bays contain exhibitions of interest
under the following heads: Insectivorous plants (at present in
the Central Hall), Parasitic plants, Water-plants, Xerophytic
plants, Epiphytic plants, Adaptations for Defence, Climbing
plants, Fertilisation of flowers (also in the Hall), and Dispersal
of seeds, a selection of British plants dried in sand and preserving
their form and colour, and a series of Lichens from
Chili. Attention may likewise be directed to a series of
coloured drawings of British Plants. At the entrance of the
gallery on the right is placed a camera to exhibit stereoscopic
views of plants in their natural colours; and on the left is a
model of a large fungus (<i>Hydnum</i>).</p>

<p>At the end of the gallery the larger specimens of Palms are
set up against the screen dividing the gallery from the Herbarium;
other Palms, Cycads, Tree-ferns, etc., are placed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
bays next the appropriate wall-cases. Suspended from the roof
is a fine specimen of the “Wabo” Bamboo (<i>Dendrocalamus</i>)
from Burma, 81 feet long; and on the floor of the gallery are
specimens of the Vegetable Sheep (<i>Raoulia</i>) of New Zealand, a
large aërial root of a Banyan, a Brazilian Tree-lily (<i>Vellozia</i>), a
large Bamboo from Demerara, an Australian Grass-tree (<i>Kingia</i>),
a Brazilian Palm (<i>Acrocomia</i>), a Sugar-cane, and a Japanese Cycad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British Plants.</div>

<p>A collection of British Plants is exhibited in glazed frames
fastened by hinges to uprights. The classification of the
Flowering Plants and Ferns is that used in Bentham’s “Handbook
of the British Flora,” and descriptions are attached as
labels to each plant.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Three series of frames contain specimens
of the British Flowering Plants and Ferns. The fourth frame
is occupied with the Mosses and Stoneworts (Characeæ), and
forms the beginning of the exhibition of Cellular Plants. The
series is continued in the frames on the other side of the gallery
containing the lower Fungi and coloured drawings of the larger
Fungi; a small series of the larger kind of Fungi found near
London is also shown. In the first bay to the right on entering
are series of coloured drawings (natural size) of edible and
poisonous fungi, and of field and cultivated mushrooms and
poisonous or worthless species often mistaken for mushrooms.
A <i>Guide</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> to the latter series has been prepared. The British
Lichens are arranged in a cabinet of shallow glass-topped drawers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Herbarium.</div>

<p>Above the entrance to the great Herbarium is a life-size
photograph of an Orchid (<i>Phalænopsis</i>) from the Philippine
Islands.</p>

<p>The portion reserved for the use of the scientific student consists
mainly of the great Herbarium of Flowering Plants. This is
a collection of dried plants, respectively fastened on single sheets
of stiff folio paper, and representing, so far as it has been possible
to obtain them, every species of living plant and the distribution
of each of these on the surface of the earth. The various
species are collected under their respective genera, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
arranged in their natural orders; the whole being classified
according to the system of Bentham and Hooker’s “Genera
Plantarum.” The plants of the British Isles form a small
separate collection. The important herbarium of Sir Hans
Sloane is kept distinct in its original form, the plants being
pasted on the pages of 333 large folios. There are other
ancient herbaria of great historic and scientific interest, as well
as an excellent working library and a collection of drawings of
plants. The Herbarium of Vascular Cryptogams (Ferns) and
Cellular Plants (Mosses, Liverworts, Algæ, Lichens, and Fungi)
is in a separate room entered from the head of the great
staircase.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
